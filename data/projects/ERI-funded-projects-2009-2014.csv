David Siegel,3/15/06,9/30/09,"$149,262 ",Princeton University,Institutes of higher education,1198,Application of Novel Satellite Carbon Biomass to Develop Ecosystem Models Capable of Predicting Climate Change,"Ocean ecosystem models are actively being developed to predict the biological response to and impact on climate change through their influence on the atmosphere-ocean distribution of CO2. Up to now, NASA’s satellite-derived observations of chlorophyll have been the most relevant global data set available for the development, evaluation, and retooling of such models. However, the variable of greatest importance to the global carbon cycle and its impact on climate is the carbon biomass of phytoplankton, not chlorophyll concentration. Consequently, interpreting the discrepancies between simulations and observations is confounded by the fact that the relationship between chlorophyll and carbon biomass is not well understood. A solution to this problem has been found. Through recent advances in ocean color data analysis it is now possible to simultaneously retrieve global distributions of phytoplankton carbon biomass and chlorophyll concentration (Behrenfeld et al., 2004, in press, attached). Based on this new data set, we propose to do the following: (1) Convert the new datasets into a form that would be useful to us and others in the field by constructing global 8-day and monthly datasets of carbon biomass and chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio (Chl:C), as well as additional variables that can be derived from these datasets including phytoplankton growth rate, mixed layer net primary production, and mixed 185 layer loss. (2) Use the resulting global carbon biomass dataset to (a) directly compare observations with model predictions of phytoplankton biomass and growth rate, and to (b) improve our existing ecosystem models and (c) develop a new generation of ''inductive'' models that will be based on the biomass and chlorophyll observations. (3) In collaboration with our colleagues at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab (GFDL), deploy our ecosystem models in coupled atmosphere-ocean global circulation climate models (AOGCMs). Run concurrently in AOGCMs, independent carbon biomass-based ecosystem models will make it possible to predict future climate change better than has been possible so far. Based on our previous experience with ecosystem models and our analyses of preliminary carbon biomass estimates, we expect that the response of our new models to global warming will be significantly different from our existing models. The prime responsibility of the UCSB group will be to produce and distribute a suite of novel satellite determinations of carbon biomass and growth rates in collaboration with researchers from Princeton University and Oregon State University. Input data for this will be SeaWiFS and MODIS Terra and Aqua missions. We will produce merged global data fields of carbon biomass, carbon to chlorophyll ratio, carbon-based primary production and phytoplankton loss rates and distribute these data sets via the world wide web. This work builds on that of a ReaSON grant to Jim Frew, Stephane Maritorena and David Siegel of UCSB. We will work with researchers from Princeton University and Oregon State University in validating these data sets and will assist in develop predictive models of carbon cycling for predicting future changes in the ocean's carbon cycle.",2006,2009
David Siegel,5/15/07,5/14/11,"$155,574 ",Princeton University,Institutes of higher education,1466,Ocean color carbon and circulation: Studies with an Earth System Model,"This work will focus on the bio-optical modeling and the application of large-scale ocean color imagery to the goals in the main proposal. Specifically, we propose to · develop bio-optical models for radiant heating applications which include colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), · assist the Princeton group in modeling of CDOM dynamics within a standard ecosystem model frame, · validate the Princeton model output using available ocean color satellite and in situ data sets, · analyze trends (time, space, EOF modal, etc.) in merged MODIS / SeaWIFS data to develop useful twin experiments for simulaitons, and · collaborate with the Princeton group in the interpretation of and publication of results from the project. The UCSB group is uniquely suited to conduct this work. For example, we have developed a large database of available bio-optical properties from which bio-optical models that include CDOM can be developed (www.icess.ucsb.edu/OCisD/request_data.html). A recent graduating student, Jon Klamberg, completed his Masters thesis developing a 1-D mixed layer model of 186 CDOM cycling at the Bermuda Atlantic Time series Site (BATS). His results will help in our modeling of CDOM dynamics within the Princeton group’s ecosystem model. Last, the UCSB group has developed a merged data set of MODIS / SeaWIFS imagery of chlorophyll concentrations, CDOM and particulate backscatter coefficients (see www.icess.ucsb.edu/~manuela/oceancolor.html).",2007,2011
Naomi Tague,1/1/10,6/30/12,"$72,115 ",Kearney Foundation,"Private agency, foundation",2009.03,Optimized Soil Moisture Sampling Design to Represent the Impact of Annual Climate Variability on Dominant Ecohydrological Orecesses in Snow-Dominated Watersheds,"Snow-dominated mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to changes in climate. Warmer temperatures lead to earlier snowmelt and a transition from snow to rain dominated water inputs. Empirical and model-based studies have shown that, for the Western U.S., these changes will likely lead to significant shifts in the seasonal timing of streamflow (Stewart et al., 2004). Changes in the timing of water inputs will also alter seasonal soil wetting-drying patterns and soil-vegetation biogeochemical cycling processes that depend on moisture conditions The goal of this project is to characterize soil moisture and coupled ecosystem responses to climate-driven changes in timing of water inputs for a watershed located at the sensitive rain- snow transition zone within the southern California Sierra Nevada range. One of the key challenges in any investigation of soil moisture driven processes is accounting for spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales. Soil moisture is highly spatially variable and controls on this variation shift with spatial and temporal scale and extent. In snowmelt driven watersheds, soil hydraulic properties may dominate at very fine scales, while spatial variation in snow accumulation and melt, vegetation cover, radiation and micro-meteorology play varying roles at increasingly coarser scales. Soil moisture sampling directed at understanding how the system responds to climate variation must take into account these multiple controls. In this project, we develop a strategic soil moisture (and vegetation water flux) sampling strategy that is explicitly designed to capture spatial heterogeneity that will likely be important in characterizing system responses to inter-annual climate variability. We use an integrated field-sampling-hydrologic modeling approach to maximize the utility of measurements and then use these results in an assessment of how changes in snow accumulation and melt will alter soil moisture and its control on vegetation water use. Our research site has recently been established as the Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. This project leverages an extensive set of ongoing field measurements and links this work with other research initiatives, including several focused on soil biogeochemical cycling. One of the key contributions of this project will be the development and application of a strategic soil moisture and sap flux sampling design based on a physically-based, spatially distributed eco-hydrologic model and associated statistical analysis, ultimately to represent the impact of annual climate variability on dominant eco-hydrologic processes. We initially calibrate the model to reproduce existing soil moisture, sap-flow and streamflow data. We use the model to generate spatial- temporal patterns of snow, soil moisture and transpiration under historical and projected future climate. These patterns are then clustered to identify areas of hydrologic similarity, where similarity will be defined by inter-annual mean and variation of a suite of hydrologic indicators (e.g. seasonal trajectories of snowmelt, root-zone soil moisture storage, and evapotranspiration). We use both traditional clustering approaches and Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the system. Additional field measurements are then taken to better represent key clusters of similar soil moisture dynamics and contribute to analysis of space-time soil moisture dynamics under a warming climate.",2010,2012

The project aims to develop and implement source identification (ID) protocols to enhance the State of California Clean Beach Initiative grant applicants‚Äô ability to design and submit competitive implementation projects for Proposition 84 funding. The program includes (1) evaluating and selecting reliable DNA-based source ID protocols and (2) testing the methods to find bacterial sources at high priority beaches. The knowledge will be transferred to local agencies and an infrastructure will be created so that future source investigations can be carried out more consistently and successfully.

Patricia Holden,1/1/14,1/31/16,"$194,209 ",Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP),"California state, municipal agencies",9406,Determination of DNA-based Fecal Marker Aging Characteristics for Use in Quantitative Microbial Source Tracking,The goal of the proposed work is to understanding how aging of fecal pollution affects the ability of managers and policy makers to interpret results from microbial source tracking assays. Microbial source tracking assays have been developed that are highly sensitive and specific and this is a great advancement in tracking sources of microbial pollution in recreational waters. Our team has evaluated modern assays for their specificity and sensitivity and has applied well- performing assays to identifying sources contributing to regional microbiological water pollution. However interpreting assay results likely depends on the source of pollution when it was released and how it changed or ‚Äúaged‚Äù within the environment. The relative abundances of assay markers are expected to change significantly during pollution source aging in the environment but the magnitude of those changes and the factors that contribute are unknown. This makes interpreting assay results from environmental samples very difficult. The overall goal of this project is to determine aging characteristics and contributing factors in the field and in the lab.,2014,2016
Patricia Holden,2/1/08,8/31/09,"$76,193 ",City of Santa Barbara,"California state, municipal agencies",22659,DNA-Based Microbial Source Tracking in Laguna Channel Santa Barbara,The City of Santa Barbara has previously identified ozone disinfection at the outlet of Laguna Channel (near the existing pump station) as an appropriate project for reducing beach warnings. Prior to moving forward with such a project the City seeks to better understand the watershed for example in terms of inputs of polluted runoff vs. uncontaminated groundwater. Additional study may identify project(s) that provide more treatment per unit cost and/or have lower maintenance costs over the lifetime of the project. Prior Mission Creek study included some sampling in the lower Laguna watershed specifically in the Channel just upstream of Chase Palm Park and in the Laguna Lagoon. Results to date support that DNA-based markers of human fecal contamination can be found in the lower Laguna watershed. However sampling to date has been limited and the samples thus far demonstrate significant temporal variability. Before investments are made in treatment infrastructure or other remedial activities towards improving creek and coastal water quality in the Laguna Channel watershed area a more comprehensive study is needed at the watershed scale to define the spatial extent and temporal patterns of fecal contamination and sources. The project seeks to identify human contamination sources their temporal (diurnal and other) variability and potentially determining other host sources of fecal bacterial contamination in water samples collected for this study.,2008,2009
Patricia Holden,10/14/08,3/31/11,"$340,000 ",City of Santa Barbara,"California state, municipal agencies",22926,Microbial Source Tracking Protocol Development,Santa Barbara like many urbanized coastal communities in California frequently determines that fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in surf zone water exceed State of California AB411 criteria. This project involved research in support of determining origins of FIB associated with human fecal pollution (sewage) in storm drains that discharge to coastal creeks flowing to Santa Barbara beaches. The overall goals were to determine origins of sewage contamination in storm drains during dry weather and to compile a protocol for other communities to use for similar source tracking purposes based on the results of this research. Research involved field work field sampling of water and fecal samples and laboratory analysis of field samples. Methods for alternative sewage indicators were researched and selected methods were recruited and tested for their utility in assessing sewage in storm drains. A novel approach was developed for studying exfiltration (sanitary to storm sewer) that involved dispensing rhodamine WT dye into sanitary sewers and detecting a fluorescence signal continuously in real time in storm drain manholes using a field-deployable battery-driven submersible optical probe with data logger. The specificity of two similar widely-used approaches for quantifying sewage contamination in water samples through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of DNA markers in human waste was tested. This involved collecting fecal samples from various non-target (raccoon gull rat dog cat) hosts and target (human septage sewage) materials then comparing the specificity of two popular qPCR- based approaches for quantifying human markers. Equipment items for flow measurement in storm drains and automated continuous sampling were researched and selected then deployed at two locations for 72 hour campaigns to better understand temporal variation in human waste contamination and in storm drain flow. A high-density microarray of DNA probes the PhyloChip was used to assess differences in fecal source bacterial communities for the non-target (as above) and human-associated (as above) fecal samples. The fecal source bacterial community profiles by PhyloChip were then compared to water sample bacterial communities for samples collected in various sites of interest based on historical FIB and/or human DNA-marker contamination. A GIS database was assembled with microbiological data‚Äîboth historical from recent studies conducted by UCSB for the City and also from this study‚Äîdisplayed along with storm drains sanitary sewers and streets with the latter three types of data already contained in the City GIS database as separate layers. The GIS database was used to generate several products for visualizing information and for planning remediation and research. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed for all procedures and assays found to be most useful in tracking human waste in storm drains. A protocol for implementing these procedures was designed for others to use in similar studies. The conclusions of this study regard how communities based on our experiences in this research should best approach source tracking human waste in storm drains.,2008,2011
Brad Hacker,4/1/13,3/31/16,1249486,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,75489,Collaborative Research: The Role of Fluids in Intermediate-Depth Seismicity and Wedge Anisitrophy: Case Studies for Cascadia and Alaska With a Comparison to Japan,Large amounts of fluid enter Earth‚Äôs mantle through subduction of hydrated oceanic sediment igneous crust and mantle. During subduction a series of progressive devolatilization reactions release fluid from the slab. Some of these fluids enter the overlying mantle wedge and trigger melting that in turn leads to arc volcanism. While it is clear that fluids play an important role in the dynamics of subduction zones the precise fluid pathways remain unclear. Details of the fluid budget the location of dehydration events and the precise role of fluids in triggering intermediate-depth seismicity also remain unquantified. Recent seismological work has provided important new insights into the position of intermediatedepth seismicity in the slab and the role of seismic anisotropy in the interpretation of seismic velocities. The first allows us to test whether fluids are responsible in generating intermediate-depth seismicity; the second leads to improvements in the seismological mapping of fluids and melts within the mantle wedge. The strong non-linear influence of fluids on material properties and wave propagation makes it essential to use a forward modeling approach where we predict the physical state of wedge and slab by dynamical models that take into account the best constraints from mineral physics and petrology. By comparing the seismological expression of these models with the observations we can iteratively improve the dynamical/petrological models. In the research proposed here we will develop new high-resolution 2D/3D finite element models of the dynamics and thermal structure of subduction zones. We will use petrological and mineral physics constraints to guide the choices for rheology and to predict the seismological expression of these models; in particular for velocity anisotropy. Using seismological modeling we will compare the predictions with observations and use an iterative approach to develop a suite of models that satisfy the observations. We will use these models to study the dynamics and structure of the subducting slab and mantle wedge at two GeoPRISMS primary sites (Alaska and Cascadia) and the well-instrumented Japan subduction system to address three main questions: 1) Does intermediate-depth seismicity indicate the presence of fluids? 2) Can we constrain the composition and deformation of the mantle wedge from observations of seismic anisotropy? 3) Can we use improved predictions for the petrological structure of the slab and anisotropic structure of the wedge to improve the locations of subduction-zone earthquakes? The focus sites are well-studied ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù subduction zone end-members and provide excellent testing grounds for the main research hypotheses.,2013,2016

Ralph Archuleta,2/1/08,1/31/12,"$120,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,SCEC3: Prediction of Broadband Time Histories,We will continue to improve this new method for predicting broadband ground motion. We propose 4 main tasks: 1) Use dynamic modeling to get a better understanding of the spatial interdependency between kinematic parameters and selecting parameters that are most suitable for implementation in a kinematic rupture model. In short we need to select the best possible correlated parameters as input to the kinematic models. 2) Use a different slip rate function than the one proposed in Liu et al. (2006). Looking at the slip rate functions in the more than 250 dynamic models that we have computed thus far we find that the slip rate model of Liu et al. (2006) has a different convexity following the peak slip rate than that in Liu et al. (2006). 3) Implement the new results in the kinematic rupture model generator and repeat the validations. The validations will include both Northridge and Loma Prieta. 4) Implement new rupture model generator in broadband simulation platform. We will work on refinement of our rupture model generator based on insights gained from dynamic modeling (Schmedes et al. 2008b). Our current analysis suggests that average rupture velocity and slip show a wide range of positive and negative correlations. Furthermore slip and local rupture velocity do not seem to be a good parameter pair to use because there is basically no correlation between the two when the rupture attains its larger speeds. This observation is illustrated in Figure 3 (top). We show the joint probability distribution for rupture velocity/shear wave velocity and slip amplitude/ average slip for one of the dynashake shakeout ruptures computed by Steve Day and Luis Dalguer. Once the rupture gained a certain speed there is no dependency of the rupture speed with the slip amplitude. We also observe this in the about 250 dynamic rupture models we have computed so far. Hence a different parameterization of the kinematic model for example using correlated peak slip rate and rupture velocity is necessary.,2008,2012
Ralph Archuleta,2/1/08,1/31/12,"$43,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,SCEC3: Rupture Nucleation and the Evolution of dc,This is a continuation of prior research goals as follows: 1) to complete our work on the effect of heterogeneities on nucleation and 2) to focus on dynamic ruptures where the effect of heterogeneous strength and stress fields are analyzed in terms of the rupture velocity and slip rate functions that they produce. The first objective will allow us to examine how fracture energy scales as the rupture initially grows. At some point the relevant length scales are likely to come from the correlation lengths found in the strength/stress fields. Exactly how the heterogeneity affects the friction law seems to follow the predictions of Campillo et al. (2001) but this still has be examined further. Once a rupture is propagating the correlation lengths of the strength/stress fields looks to be of primary importance. We have already shown that if the fields are strongly correlated the rupture velocity can range from sub- to super-shear. Whereas if the fields are weakly correlated the rupture velocity is generally limited to sub-shear. The dynamics of the rupture from initiation through completion forms the basis for earthquake physics. Phenomena from earthquake scaling spontaneous triggering crack behavior versus pulse-like to ground motion prediction depend fundamentally on what happens during the spontaneous propagation of a frictional shear fracture. It is only recently that we have had the tools and the computational power to explore the fundamentals of the earthquake process. However we cannot model the stress heterogeneity on all scales. Thus we must determine an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù friction law that accounts for the stress heterogeneity at scales smaller than what can be modeled. Using this effective friction we will explore its consequences on the dynamics of a propagating rupture.,2008,2012

Set up validation of the 1994 Northridge earthquake We validated our simulation methods for the 1994 Northridge earthquake before the Platform was developed. In this task we will set up the validation of our high frequency simulation method for the 1994 Northridge earthquake on the Platform using our simulation method. The Platform will be set up so that other investigators can repeat the validation exercises of these earthquakes on the Platform. URS will provide the following data and metadata: rupture models derived using 3D velocity models lists of recording stations and their Vs30 values and generic 1D velocity models. Task 2. Set up validation of the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1992 Landers earthquakes We will set up the validation of our high frequency simulation method for the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1992 Landers earthquakes on the Platform. The Platform will be set up so that other investigators can repeat the validation exercises of these earthquakes on the Platform. URS will provide the following data and metadata: rupture models derived using 3D velocity models lists of recording stations and their Vs30 values and generic 1D velocity models. Task 3. Implement improvements to the broadband simulation procedures that have been made since the initial installation of the Broadband Platform Improvements to the broadband simulation procedures have been made to the procedures that were initially installed on the platform. The improved simulation procedures will be implemented on the Broadband Platform. Task 4. Separation of ground motion simulation and site response simulation into separate modules in the Broadband Platform Currently the strong motion simulation codes incorporate site response in the same module. The site response component needs to placed into a separate module so that the user of the platform can select from alternative site response modules. In due course additional site response modules from other SCEC investigators such as Assimaki will be added to the platform but they will not be usable with the broadband simulation methods until this separation is made. Task 5. Verification of methods for measuring goodness of fit for validation of simulations on the Broadband Platform Validation of strong motion simulation procedures against strong motion recordings requires measures of goodness of fit. The purpose of this task is to install and test a comprehensive suite of measures of goodness of fit on the platform to allow the user of the platform to select and use implement their preferred measures in the course of validation exercises. SDSU will take the lead (in a separate contract) in developing these modules for the Platform and UCSB and URS will review and test the modules.,2009,2012
Ralph Archuleta,2/1/07,1/31/12,"$8,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,A Collaborative Project: Rupture Dynamics Validation of the Numerical Simulation Method,In 2011 we plan to visit heterogeneous initial stress conditions on a planar vertical fault TPV18. With classic benchmark TPV5 we have already addressed light stress heterogeneity on a vertical strike-slip fault but it was so light as to be almost homogeneous. Instead we wish to address the true variability that is envisioned for most faults by earthquake geologists and seismologists. Many members of our SCEC code community participated in a PGE/SCEC workshop in May 2010 where different approaches to assigning heterogeneous initial stress conditions were presented and discussed. Subsequently a hybrid method has been developed and implemented to assign heterogeneous initial conditions in the limited-PI PGE/SCEC dipping-fault 100-runs project. It is now time that we investigate this heterogeneity topic as an open group exercise. TPV18 is proposed to be an implementation of the a hybrid method but on a vertical strike-slip fault. It is also hoped that TPV18 will help address some interesting issues that have arisen in the 100-runs project whereby the near-surface results produced by the three assigned codes although matching well at some of the synthetic ground motion stations do not match as perfectly as we had originally hoped for the dipping-fault scenario. By having our entire code group tackle a related benchmark on a vertical fault we hope that we can solve this problem and move forward with future heterogeneous initial conditions research and implementation. UCSB will work on only this problem within the Collaborative Project.,2007,2012
Ralph Archuleta Jamison Steidl,2/1/07,1/31/12,"$135,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,SCEC3 Participation: SCEC Borehole Instrumentation Center,The SCEC borehole program continues to be a collaborative effort between SCEC and other agencies to maintain the existing network of borehole stations in California and to facilitate the integration of this data into CISN and the SCEC data center. The borehole program is highly leveraged taking advantage of the resources of other programs and agencies that are active in monitoring southern California earthquake activity. This data is made available online to the public and research community. The SCEC borehole data gathering effort is contributing to the overall scientific goals of the SCEC collaboratory. For example the borehole data available online at the SCEDC and at IRIS from the SCEC/PBO stations in the Anza region are providing a unique new high-resolution data set for analysis of earthquake source parameters (Priority A4) as well as providing observations of non-volcanic tremor induced events in the region following large regional and very large global earthquakes. In addition the borehole instrumentation is critical to improving our understanding of nonlinear effects and to developing methodologies to include these effects into ground motion simulations (Priority B4 B5). As has been the case for many years joint monitoring efforts continue between SCEC and the US Geological Survey and Caltech through ANSS NSMP and CISN and the California Geological Survey to maintain the existing network of borehole stations. Other collaborators include the NSF funded NEES and HPWREN programs as well as a newly funded NSF project to look at the San Jacinto Fault zone including the installation of additional borehole sensors. In 2011 SCEC borehole stations will continue to be upgraded along with the CISN network stations in southern California. This includes migration to new datalogger technology and the upgrade of surface sensors. As the SCEC borehole stations come up on the schedule for network wide upgrades we will continue to work with the SCSN field technicians during the upgrade process. The SCEC borehole program will also continue the collaboration with the NEES program (Priority B6) through processing and data dissemination of the SCEC borehole data; the SCEC/EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory borehole strainmeter program that includes both weak- and strong-motion seismic monitoring in the Anza region; and the strong-motion borehole sensors being installed as part of a new NSF funded study of the San Jacinto fault zone.,2007,2012
Ralph Archuleta Dylan Rood,2/1/07,1/31/12,"$20,053 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,Evolution of Precariously Balanced Rocks in the Mojave Desert:Constraints on San Andreas Fault Rupture and Hazard Models,The primary goal of this study is to constrain the evolution (timing and formation rate) and comparative geomorphic development of precariously balanced rocks (PBRs) at two well- characterized but contrasting sites in the Mojave Desert: one in a region of low seismicity (Granite Pediment) and another (Lovejoy Buttes) with high hazard from numerous large (~M7.5) San Andreas fault (SAF) ruptures. Results from PBRs (ages and fragilities) will directly test seismicity models ground motion prediction equations and hazard estimates associated with the 2008 USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps (NSHM) and Cybershake. Detailed work will be conducted in one catchment at each site. Morphometric characteristics of each catchment (e.g. area slope hypsometry channel steepness) will be analyzed using a digital elevation model (DEM) constructed using ground-based LiDAR and differential-GPS survey data (with collaborator B. Bookhagen). 10Be stream sediment samples will allow us to estimate the average denudation rate in each basin where PBRs were exhumed. Saprolite will be sampled near a PBR in each catchment to address the site-specific denudation rate. Detailed profiles will be collected from a total of 5 additional PBRs (3 rocks from Granite Pediment and 2 additional rocks from Lovejoy Buttes) in order to address the timing of PBR exhumation (with collaborator G. Balco). At Granite Pediment a 10Be sample from a slowly eroding bedrock exposure on the pediment surface will be used to estimate the grain-by-grain rock erosion rate. Our goal is to compile new and existing shape models tipping test 10Be data and VML limiting ages for the Mojave Desert PBRs. We will systematically compare results from (1) 2-D alpha and 3-D overturning probability estimates from shape models with quasi-static toppling accelerations and alpha calculations from force-inclination (tipping) tests and (2) model 10Be exposure ages with minimum VML ages.,2007,2012
Ralph Archuleta,2/1/07,1/31/12,"$24,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,120044,Rupture Dynamics on Sulti-Segment Faults,The basic goals of this research are as following: 1) Calculate multiple earthquake scenarios on a multi-segment fault to understand how the absolute initial stress conditions influence the rupture behavior and the resulting ground motion. Assigning absolute stress values in the dynamic rupture calculations is controversial. For example with constant static and dynamic coefficients of friction one would expect the stress drop to increase with depth if œÉN increases with depth ‚Äîas would be expected because of the lithostatic overburden. However estimates of stress drop show no clear evidence of increasing with depth. We can have nearly constant shear stress as well as stress drop out of uniform normal stress œÉN. However with increasing normal stress œÉN along depth we tend to get depth dependent stress drops (Dalguer and Mai 2010). Previous research (Shearer et al 2006 Allmann and Shearer 2007 Hardebeck 2009) shows that the median stress drop tends to be depth independent for depths as much as 15 km. An approach taken by Aagaard and Heaton (2001) reconciles the depth dependent normal stress and depth independent stress drop by making the friction coefficient depth dependent. Rice (1992) proposed making the effective normal stress constant by allowing the pore pressure to increase linearly with depth. It is likely that the configuration of the initial stress conditions has a pronounced effect on allowing the jump from one fault to another. Both a depth dependent and a depth independent initial stress will be considered. Of course in both cases the stress will be overprinted stress heterogeneity (LavalleÃÅe et al 2006). 2) Investigate the geometrical conditions (degree of overlapping and step over between adjacent segments) under which a cascading earthquake can occur. Whether an earthquake will be limited to a single fault or will jump over physical boundaries between faults makes a significant difference in the seismic moment and ground motion. To give a more reliable estimate of seismic hazard in areas with multi-segmented faults we will focus on two parameters: separation distance and overlapping distance between the adjacent fault segments. We will systematically alter these two parameters to quantify the conditions when a rupture jumps from one segment to another. 3) Study the velocity strengthening layer its depth and its implementation. In rupture dynamics as well as rock physics studies it is well known that the friction on the fault plane is slip rate dependent (e.g. Dieterich 1979). Based on laboratory experiments (Blanpied et al. 1991) the upper 3-4 km of the crust would show velocity strengthening. In this zone the friction increases with the slip rate and thus would inhibit slip (Scholz 1998). Earthquakes such as Morgan Hill Loma Prieta Tottori Parkfield are events with M > 6 but with no obvious co- seismic slip at the surface. There are different ways to mimic the friction in the velocity strengthening zone when using a slip weakening friction law. For example one can make the critical distance dc infinite in the zone (e.g. Day and Ely 2002) increase dynamic friction 1coefficient to static coefficient level (e.g. Barall et al 2010) or make the dynamic friction coefficient velocity dependent (e.g. Aagaard et al 2004).

We will use the BVDA data and the data from the SCEC deployment that coincide with events recorded at BVDA. In doing this we will determine Q(f). We will also try to determine site amplification factors for the SCEC portable stations; we will back out the amplification using BVDA data or by using representative shallow velocity structure measured in Imperial Valley. We will compare stress drops of the aftershocks with those on the San Jacinto to see i) if the same spatial distribution exists as found by Shearer et al. (2006) and ii) if stress drops for 4.0 < M < 5.5 have the same median and variation found for events in other magnitude ranges. We will use the spatial variation of the stress on the northern end (Paso Superior fault) as a proxy for the slip in a finite fault simulation (Schmedes et al. 2010). Our intent is to use an empirical Green‚Äôs function approach (Archuleta et al. 2003) to simulate the mainshock ground motion at BVDA. Simulations of the mainshock by Graves and Aagaard (2010) show that the radiated waves are strongly refracted by the velocity structure causing focusing in the region near BVDA as opposed to the expected strong directivity along strike. This may explain why the spectrum of the El Mayor mainshock at BVDA is amplified and its corner frequency much higher than expected.,2007,2012

Using methods from robust control theory [Dullerus and Paganini 2005] this project develops bounds on source characteristics by defining and solving a series of optimization problems which maximize the information extracted from seismic inversions and determine which features are well-constrained by the data. Quantifying uncertainty in kinematic inversions is necessary in order to interpret the variability and features seen in source models. While kinematic inversions provide direct images of the seismic source the robust features of these images are not well known. A thorough treatment of the consequences of uncertain models and statistical correlations in seismic inversions is necessary in order to characterize the inherent variability of the seismic process. This work fits SCEC3 objectives A4 A10 and B1. Objective A4 calls for statistical analysis and mapping of source parameters with an emphasis on their relation to known faults. Our project focuses on better understanding the statistical correlations between possible models of slip (and therefore stress change) on the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault. Also Objective A10 describes the development of statistical descriptions of heterogeneities over multiple earthquake cycles. Indeed the Parkfield segment is ideal for studying the earthquake cycle as data from multiple moderately sized earthquakes have been recorded there. It is necessary to know the error in inversion methods in order to determine to what extent the Parkfield earthquake are ‚Äúcharacteristic‚Äù. Finally Objective B1 asks for the development of kinematic rupture scenarios consistent with observations. Our project seeks to better describe this large solution space that is consistent with observations (as opposed to selecting only a few arbitrary models from this space).,2007,2012

Determination of the deformational history of the last unstudied fold belt in southern California is essential to understanding the temporal and spatial patterns of deformation in the western Transverse Ranges and to elucidating how this region accommodates plate boundary deformation. In order to successfully achieve this goal we will need to determine the middle Pleistocene-Holocene chronology of deformed strata in the CFB. Terrestrial strata in the CFB are currently correlated with the Saugus Formation deformed at South Mountain and regions to the north and west. The upper age limit of Pleistocene strata in this part of the western Transverse Ranges is unknown. Because the age of these deposits is beyond the reliable range of most Quaternary chronometers we propose to date these deposits using U-series dating of pedogenic carbonates of which are abundant within the Saugus Formation in the CFB and elsewhere.,2007,2012

The borehole program is highly leveraged, taking advantage of the resources of other programs and agencies that are active in monitoring southern California earthquake activity. This data is made available online to the public and research community. The SCEC borehole data gathering effort is contributing to the overall scientific goals of the SCEC collaboratory. For example, the borehole data available online at the SCEDC and at IRIS from the SCEC/PBO stations in the Anza region are providing a unique new high-resolution data set for analysis of earthquake source parameters (Priority A4), as well as providing observations of non-volcanic tremor induced events in the region following large regional and very large global earthquakes. In addition, the borehole instrumentation is critical to improving our understanding of nonlinear effects and to developing methodologies to include these effects into ground motion simulations (Priority B4, B5). As has been the case for many years, joint monitoring efforts continue between SCEC and the US Geological Survey and Caltech through ANSS, NSMP, and CISN, and the California Geological Survey to maintain the existing network of borehole stations. Other collaborators include the NSF funded NEES and HPWREN programs, as well as a newly funded NSF project to look at the San Jacinto Fault zone, including the installation of additional borehole sensors. In 2011, SCEC borehole stations will continue to be upgraded along with the CISN network stations in southern California. This includes migration to new datalogger technology and the upgrade of surface sensors. As the SCEC borehole stations come up on the schedule for network wide upgrades, we will continue to work with the SCSN field technicians during the upgrade process.

The new systems use commercial grade cellular VPN routers or other available Internet based telemetry that allows for continuous transmission of data back to the USGS/Caltech component of CISN. Ongoing projects using PBIC equipment include: real-time deployment of the PBIC stations along the Elsinore fault zone; array deployment of 10 RefTek stations at Pinon Flat to monitor potential tremor activity in the region; and use of the broadband CMG-40T sensors at stations in the Anza regional network. There are no upcoming project on the schedule for 2011 although there have been a couple of inquiries as to instrument availability. What typically happens is projects will develop throughout the course of the year that utilize the PBIC equipment, and we will continue to support these projects as instruments are requested. Maintaining a pool of working stations for rapid deployment in the event of a significant earthquake in California remains the first priority of the PBIC. In addition to support of field deployments, the PBIC project will continue to maintain the existing pool of older instruments including the long-term loan equipment from the IRIS PASSCAL instrument center and newly acquired RefTek 72A series instruments from the DOE. Heavy involvement of undergraduates is an important part of the PBIC operations as these student laboratory assistants perform the majority of the routine maintenance work under the supervision of the PI and/or engineering staff at the Earth Research Institute.

Specific tasks are: § Re-examination of SKS data: While our surface wave model shows strong anisotropy close to the major faults, there is no such reports on SKS data so far. We have examined SKS data in Southern California in 2008 but we need to extend the region toward north in order to conclusively determine the change in anisotropic pattern. § Re-examination of long-period surface wave data: It seems almost certain that deeper anisotropic layer is required to explain the two types of data simultaneously. However, our current Rayleigh-wave data do not contain long period (> 100 sec) information and thus it would be hard to examine internal consistency between SKS data and Rayleigh wave data. We will re-examine long-period (>100 sec) surface wave data and expand the frequency range of the data set. § Develop finite-frequency approach for SKS splitting data and perform joint inversion: As both SKS data and surface wave data are long period and differ in their 221 lateral wavelengths, it is important to take into account finite-frequency effects. We intend to reformulate both approaches and invert the data. § Anisotropy and S velocities in the SCEC_CLM and SCEC_CVM: Our data on S velocities and anisotropy will be input to the California Lithosphere model.

However even when human-specific contamination can be traced to general areas finding exact origins remains challenging due to sample costs and processing times. This study sought to test the use of a new qualitative tool for source tracking canine scent tracking (sewage-sniffing dogs) to provide real-time results and low sample cost for illicit discharge detection. This research fulfilled a contract with the City of Santa Barbara (City) to evaluate canine scent tracking as a water quality tool for storm water managers and water quality researchers. The low cost rapid and real-time nature of canine-scent tracking‚Äîas a screening approach for sewage-contaminated waters‚Äîmake if an attractive and tractable tool for small communities. However while canine scent tracking is invaluable in criminal forensics its use in environmental forensics particularly with regards to its accuracy in revealing sewage in environmental waters has been unknown. The collaboration included Scott and Karen Reynolds of Environmental Canine Services LLC (ECS) along with their trained dogs Sable and Logan. The research mainly involved determining if sampling locations contaminated with sewage as previously determined by quantitative DNA-based microbial source tracking traditional indicator bacteria tests and chemical fingerprinting were indicated as contaminated by canine scent tracking. Another objective was to determine if canine scent tracking can be used to further locate or bracket sources of human waste in a storm drain network that have been confirmed by microbial source tracking. Canine responses were compared against traditional wastewater indicators illicit discharge detection tracers and emerging human-specific waste markers in storm drain locations in Santa Barbara CA. Canine scent tracking was also tested for effectiveness in locating contaminated inputs to storm drains addressing a specific hypothesis of contamination arising from illicit dumping from recreational vehicles and conducting systematic watershed reconnaissance. Based on the statistical and qualitative results presented in this pilot- scale study canine scent tracking is a tool that should be expanded for use by researchers and stormwater managers.,2010,2011

Bruce Kendall,9/15/06,8/31/11,"$201,944 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,615024,Collaborative Research: Demographic heterogeneity within populations and its consequences,Demographic heterogeneity is likely to be an important determinant of a population‚Äôs dynamics impacting demographic stochasticity low-density growth rate equilibrium density and rate of spatial spread. These are of fundamental ecological importance and may have evolutionary consequences as well; they certainly will influence a population‚Äôs risk of extinction or invasion. However these models are by dint of their simplicity limited in a variety of ways. They are for the most part non-spatial and focus on asymptotic rather than transient dynamics. Where interactions between individuals is included (e.g. density-dependence) it is modeled as a mean-field effect with no consideration of potential variability in local density. Interspecific interactions have not been examined. And finally while many studies have empirically documented heterogeneity of various sorts there has been no integrated assessment of the effects of heterogeneity on the dynamics of an actual population. We propose to extend our understanding of the population impacts of demographic heterogeneity in a variety of ways. Demographic heterogeneity and spatially local interactions: spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions is an important driver of demographic heterogeneity especially in sessile organisms such as plants. In these species competitive interactions and often dispersal are local and mean field models may be inappropriate. We will use spatially explicit models to analyze the effects of demographic heterogeneity in such populations adding spatial pattern to the endpoints we have already examined in nonspatial models. Demographic heterogeneity and invasion dynamics: our previous work used idealized dispersal kernels and deterministic dynamics but low densities in the leading edge of the invasion front mean that both demography and realized dispersal can be highly stochastic. We will use individual-based spatial models to evaluate how demographic heterogeneity affects the mean and variance of invasion speed. We will also use the model to investigate the conditions required to generate the pattern (observed e.g. in the cane toad invasion) of increasingly strong dispersal ability in the leading edge of the invasion. Demographic heterogeneity and interspecific interactions: we will introduce demographic heterogeneity into models of interacting species (both competitive and consumer- resource interactions) to evaluate how such heterogeneity impacts coexistence criteria and qualitative features of predator-prey cycles. Demographic heterogeneity and the dynamics of a threatened bird species: in collaboration with scientists at the Archbold Biological Station we will use recently developed statistical tools to quantify demographic heterogeneity in a well-studied population of Florida scrub-jays. We will then use our model framework to evaluate how this heterogeneity affects the population dynamics and long-term viability of the population. Insights for metapopulation dynamics: exploiting the qualitative similarity between the density-dependent population model in Stover et al. (2011a) and classic metapopulation models we will develop models that introduce heterogeneity in patch characteristics (extinction and colonization rates). We will investigate whether these models can provide insights into the dynamics of heterogeneous metapopulations that complement or generalize the results of spatially explicit metapopulation models.,2006,2011
David Siegel,9/15/06,8/31/10,"$199,410 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,628389,Collaborative Research: Carbon Flux through the twilight zone - new tools to measure change,"Changes in the distribution of carbon within the ocean are caused by a combination of physicochemical and biological processes. The first of these two, the so-called “solubility pump”, injects carbon into the deep sea through the sinking of cold waters at high latitudes where CO2 solubility is enhanced (Feely et al., 2001; Sabine et al., 2004). The so-called oceanic “biological pump” is highly dynamic and variable in space and time. This process operates through the production of organic carbon by organisms in the surface ocean and the subsequent sequestration of this material below the winter mixed layer (Volk and Hoffert, 1985). Significant effort has gone into understanding the controls of the biological pump and while the general function is understood, the details remain elusive. At present, we know much more about processes in the surface euphotic zone, than in the Twilight Zone (i.e. mesopelagic). It is within the poorly understood Twilight Zone where changes in C attenuation on sinking particles and the composition of sinking material have important consequences for the rates of C uptake and exchange at the surface ocean with the atmosphere, and for longer term C sequestration in the deep sea. This proposal sets out to develop improved particle flux collectors and use these to answer key science questions associated with C fluxes and exchange via sinking particles at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) site (e.g. Michaels and Knap, 1996). Currently at BATS, we can’t balance surface ocean C budgets, annual new production estimates, or link production and community structure to predict particle export, and regularly fail to capture episodic flux events. At the same time, we are trying to answer these questions using an imperfect tool, the drifting sediment trap, a device that has served us well but has not changed significantly since the early 1980’s. 180 This program is both innovative and ambitious, with the development and engineering of new tools and its emphasis on the collection of multi-annual time-series data, while being realistic in starting from proven technology. We start by building upon our recent success with the neutrally buoyant sediment trap (NBST), but recognize that continuous flux collection and swimmer free samples are needed, as envisioned for our new design- the Twilight Zone EXplorer (TZEX). In context of the C and Water in the Earth System Program, this proposal advances our understanding of the carbon cycle by combining the following multidisciplinary elements: • basic research in ocean biology obtained from ship based observations and remote sensing • geochemistry of particles and waters and how these change with depth and time • modeling of biological processes and particle transport in moving fluids • the engineering and application of novel observational equipment to capture sinking particles These unique sediment trap devices will open up a new window to assess the ocean’s role as a C sink and how marine export production will change in response to climate change (Bopp et al., 2001, 2005). This study provides parallel science and engineering opportunities over longer time- series which are difficult to support in core programs, but are essential if we are to make a major improvement in our understanding of ocean C fluxes. The UCSB group proposes to conduct a combination of remote sensing, numerical modeling and data analysis tasks to assess the role of time/space variability of export around the trap deployments on the monthly inferences of C export. During the time series operations, the UCSB group will help in at-field sampling by forecasting where the deployed TZEX and NBST traps will go and where did they collect sinking particles (as we did in VERTIGO). This requires some at-sea work measuring and analyzing currents from the R/V Ocean Explorer’s ADCP system and combining them with satellite altimetry maps of surface currents. This will require UCSB staff (Fields and Siegel) to go to Bermuda many times during this grant period. We will also assess the sampling scales of the NBST and tethered traps deployed here and will analyze available merged ocean color imagery to assess the time/space variability of Chl and NPP surrounding each trap deployment enabling us to assess the importance of episodic blooms.

Brad Hacker,7/15/07,6/30/12,"$312,317 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,708934,Collaborative Research: How is Rifting Exhuming the Youngest HP/UHP Rocks on Earth?,At the Woodlark rift of eastern Papua New Guinea an active oceanic spreading center terminates along strike into a continental rift. In this region of active and rapid continental extension Late Miocene-Pliocene eclogites have been exhumed at cm/yr rates within the lower plates of metamorphic core complexes (MCCs). We propose a 5-year multidisciplinary project to address two key questions in continental dynamics: How does lithosphere rupture? How are HP/UHP terranes formed and exhumed? We will use eastern Papua New Guinea as a field laboratory to examine how the lithosphere has evolved petrologically rheologically and thermally during the transition from subduction to rifting and seafloor spreading. Geologic fieldwork will document the spatial distribution temporal sequence and kinematics of ductile to brittle fabrics in metamorphic magmatic and sedimentary rocks of the conjugate rifted margins the MCCs west of the active seafloor spreading rift tip and the inferred youngest MCC (Dayman Dome). Analytical work will document the pressure-temperature-time deformation n evolution tion of exhumed rocks as well as the melting conditions and sources that have given rise to volcanic rocks. A passive seismic deployment will image the crust and mantle beneath and north of MCCs where partially exhumed HP/UHP rocks may occur at depth. Rock physical properties modeling will integrate petrophysical lab measurements of HP/UHP field samples electron back-scatter diffraction studies of lattice preferred orientations and quantitative mineral-physical-properties calculations for determining seismic wave speeds of rocks. GPS surveys will provide direct measurements of horizontal strain rates associated with HP/UHP exhumation and microplate kinematics. Geodynamic modeling will numerically simulate MCC evolution and exhumation of HP/UHP rocks. All data will be integrated by tectonic synthesis to test end-member models proposed for the tectonic evolution of the region and address the two key questions above. The eastern Papua New Guinea HP/UHP terrane will be compared to similar terranes globally to assess whether exhumation mechanisms documented in this region can be applied to other HP/UHP terranes. Results will contribute to an improved understanding of the processes governing the origin structure composition and dynamic evolution of continental building blocks. These processes include deformation localization within the crust exhumation of UHP rocks and the fundamental processes by which the Earth‚Äôs tectonic plates rift and rupture.,2007,2012

The conceptual basis of the research proposed here is to develop insight into the relationship between bacterial diversity and biogeochemical processes by exploring the mechanistic basis of ecological succession in a natural bacterioplankton community. This study will build on the doctoral candidate’s previous dissertation work demonstrating how predictable bacterioplankton succession in high-elevation lakes is linked to landscape-scale snowmelt-driven changes in the composition and source of dissolved organic matter. Here we aim to illustrate how specific taxa within the pelagic bacterial community respond to changes in the rate and character of inputs of catchment-derived dissolved organic matter and bacteria in order to understand the landscape drivers of bacterioplankton succession. First the exact taxonomic identity of predefined successional communities will be defined via nucleic acid cloning, permitting modeling of the rates and vectors of change of specific taxa in relation to observed temporal shifts in specific organic compounds. Factorial experimental manipulation of organic matter sources and bacterioplankton community types within in situ mesocosm growth cultures will determine how changes in taxonomic composition are coupled to the metabolism of specific dissolved organic compounds. Finally, using quantitative-PCR, the role of inflowing catchment-derived bacterial taxa in the successional progression will be examined under various hydrological regimes, providing insight into the rates of assembly of microbial communities. Together the results of these studies will be analyzed to determine how taxonomic composition in bacterial communities is linked to the metabolism of specific dissolved organic compounds, and how ecological theories of community assembly, succession, and ecosystem metabolism may be applied to explaining microbial diversity in time and space.",2007,2009

The age and uplift history of the Sierra are currently the subject of geologic debate by workers using a variety of data sources and analytical tools including U-Th-He thermochronology fission track analyses paleobotanical studies dating of cave sediments oxygen isotope analysis of authigenic minerals and analysis of relict landscape. This study will address the following questions: (1) What can Tertiary strata preserved in paleochannels tell us about the evolution of the central Sierran landscape and how does its evolution compare with the rest of the range? (2) What can Neogene volcanic and intrusive rocks centers in the central Sierra Nevada tell us about the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the Tertiary Ancestral Cascades arc? (3) When did Neogene range-front faulting begin in the central Sierra Nevada what is its nature and has it proceeded continuously or episodically? Faults at the Sierra Nevada - Basin and Range boundary are important for determining the kinematic boundary conditions for transtensional deformation in the Walker Lane Belt. Detailed mapping in crestal areas of the central Sierra where Tertiary strata are abundant will concentrate on areas with excellent exposure and mappable dateable unaltered volcanic stratigraphy described here. Field work will include detailed mapping of volcanic-volcaniclastic lithofacies paleocanyon boundaries bedrock structure and faults using satellite images air photos and digital terrain models at various scales compiled in ARC-GIS with GPS data. Standard basin analysis techniques will be applied including paleocurrent analysis measurement of sections documentation of key stratigraphic and structural relationships on photomosaics and construction of fence diagrams and cross sections that illustrate stratigraphic relationships across canyons. Age controls will be provided by 39Ar/40Ar geochronology on volcanic rocks and petrographic and geochemical analysis of volcanic rocks will strengthen lithologic correlations.,2007,2013
Cathy Busby,7/1/07,6/30/10,"$206,678 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,711276,Collaborative Research: Origin and Significance of High Potassium Volcanism: Insights from the Ancestral Cascades California,Although high K2O volcanism has been investigated for decades its origin remains unclear. Our preliminary field and geochemical data show that the ancestral Cascades arc in the central Sierra Nevada and eastern California is the ideal place to study the significance of K2O in regard to arc- related magmatism and the respective roles of the lithosphere and asthenosphere in generating continental volcanics. The medium to high-K eruptive products in the central Sierra are distinctive and widespread and are underlain and overlain by mappable and dateable andesite units enabling us to correlate changes in magmatism with other events such as faulting uplift or changes in volcanic styles. The exposures are superior with erosion to a level that is ideal for defining extrusive-intrusive suites and the rocks are relatively pristine. Best of all basalt lava flows are present at all stratigraphic levels allowing us to evaluate temporal changes in magma evolution and mantle sources. Despite these advantages most of these rocks remain unmapped and undated. Yet the central Sierra Nevada forms the core of two large NSF projects the Sierra Nevada EarthScope and Sierra Drips Continental Dynamics projects which seek to determine if lithosphere delamination occurred in the northern and central Sierra and what its effects might be on volcanic activity. The work proposed here will provide an important and much-needed geologic and geochronologic framework for petrologic study of high- K rocks of the ancestral Cascades arc. We will test three petrologic-tectonic models for high K2O volcanism: 1) Many workers have proposed that high-K volcanism is a signal of lithosphere delamination. But observations in the southern Sierra Nevada present a problem. With removal of the lithosphere delamination should yield basalts that show a shift towards more depleted asthenosphere-like isotope ratios. Instead in the southern Sierra high-K volcanic rocks have low 143Nd/144Nd and high La/Nb ratios which prior work shows are indicative of a mantle lithosphere source. The central Sierra Nevada provides an independent test of the delamination-high K2O link. 2) As subduction ceases fluid inputs from the slab should decrease along with ratios that are indicative of a slab component such as Sr/P and Ba/Nb. It has been proposed that high K2O contents in the southern Sierra Nevada show a subduction- related component and hence may reflect an arc-post arc transition through passage of the Mendocino triple junction. If so trace element ratios that reflect slab- derived inputs elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada (e.g. Sr/P Ba/Nb) should decrease across the MTJ transition and correlate with K2O. 3) A third possibility for the origin of high K2O volcanism is that they derive from deep-seated fractional crystallization of a clinopyroxene-dominated mineral assemblage. Experimental data and our preliminary petrographic results suggest that this model is viable i.e. that a southward increase in crustal thickness in the Sierra Nevada yields a southward increase in depths of magma stagnation (greater clinopyroxene fractionation) and by consequence increased K2O values. We propose to test this last model using clinopyroxene thermobarometers which are predicted to yield progressively greater crystallization depths to the south. These three models are all clearly testable the results of which will greatly enhance our understanding of the proper interpretation of the geochemical signals provided by volcanic rocks.,2007,2010

Results of these experiments will comprise a major advance in our understanding of fluid processes within oceanic crust and will develop new tools and methods that can be applied in many settings. An earlier grant funded engineering design and testing in preparation for these experiments; the current proposal requests science support. Proposed experiments will begin during an expedition of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) currently scheduled for Summer 2008 and will extend four years beyond the drilling expedition. Funds requested will support construction of scientific instrumentation; emplacement recovery and replacement of long-term instruments by submersible or ROV; collection of seafloor and subseafloor data and samples from observatory systems; analysis of data and samples; numerical modeling of coupled fluid-heat-solute transport using conditional simulation; training of students; and presentation and publication of results. Large-scale long-term experiments will be run using a network of six subseafloor observatories on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This is an ideal place for this work based on earlier drilling experience available infrastructure extensive site surveys and a broad understanding of crustal properties and fluid flow patterns. Three borehole observatories were installed as part of IODP Expedition 301 (Summer 2004) and three additional observatories will be installed in Summer 2008. Specific questions to be addressed include: (1) What is the nature (magnitude distribution) of permeability in upper oceanic crust? (2) What are the magnitudes and directions of driving forces fluid fluxes and associated solute and heat transport? (3) What are the magnitude and nature of storage properties including pressure- temporal- and spatial- dependence? (4) What are relations between fluid flow vertical and horizontal compartmentalization transport and distribution of microorganisms alteration structure and primary crustal lithology? (5) How large are fluid reservoirs what are fluid residence times and velocities and how do these respond to perturbations (controlled pumping tides seismic events)? During the 2008 drilling expedition an existing borehole observatory will be replaced and two new observatories will be installed all monitoring multiple crustal levels. Observatories will include the latest generations of pressure instrumentation continuous fluid sampling systems microbial colonization substrate and autonomous temperature logging instruments within the sealed holes. We will run a 24-hour fluid injection experiment in one borehole during drilling and monitor formation response in five other holes 35 m - 2400 m away. We will inject a mixture of tracers to be used in single-hole and cross-hole transport studies. After one-two years of borehole equilibration following drilling we will use the natural formation overpressure to run a free-flow aquifer test for 1-2 years allowing us to quantify crustal hydrogeologic properties at enormous spatial scales and to sample and analyze formation fluids and microbes.,2007,2009

Daniel Lavallee Ralph Archuleta,7/15/08,6/30/11,"$250,000 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,738954,Dynamics of Earthquake Rupture on Heterogeneous Faults,The study of the earthquake source has evolved from point sources to kinematic to dynamics as the basic physics of the process has become the focus of source studies. Spatial heterogeneities in the initial stress across the fault surface are critical factors in constraining the dynamics of earthquake rupture and the resulting seismic radiation. Furthermore recent studies have shown that the properties of spatial heterogeneities found in finite-fault source inversions can be captured and modeled with the help of random models. We propose to use this random model to generate statistically credible initial stress spatial distributions that can be used as input to 3D dynamic models for computing scenarios of earthquake ruptures and their radiated field. We use slip distributions from kinematic inversions of data as starting models for the initial stress distribution. Whereas the kinematic inversions have resolution of 1 km or greater the dynamic modeling depends critically on scale lengths of ~100 m. The proposed method ensures that the statistical properties of the initial stress at ~100 m will correspond to the same statistics at ~1 km and vice versa. The scenarios will be used to study the qualitative and quantitative features e.g. local rupture velocity of the rupture dynamics as a function of the random properties of the initial stress. We will also examine the dependence between the random properties of the radiated fields and the random properties of the initial stress. These numerical experiments will be repeated for different friction laws (slip weakening rate-and-state dependent law and the free volume friction law) to assess any dependence between the formulation of the friction law and the expansion of the rupture.,2008,2011
Chris Sorlien,1/1/08,2/28/11,"$62,050 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,739745,Seismic Stratigraphic Correlations Across Ross Sea for ROSSMAP: Paleoclimate and Tectonics,"Existing publications propose early Miocene-Oligocene glaciation of Central High paleo-islands and of a basin adjacent to Marie Byrd Land. Was the imaged erosion due to Piedmont glaciers, or did ice sheets scour the full 300 km width of Eastern Basin? We use seismic reflection profiles, correlated to Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) sites 270 and 272, to interpret the stratigraphy of Eastern Basin. Evidence for early Miocene-Oligocene glacial erosion of the basin flanks include 100 m-high mounds or ridges on a pre-25 Ma unconformity and multiple scour surfaces with grooves interpreted as glacial megaflutes. Near the present ice shelf edge, a ~25 Ma unconformity cuts through a stack of unconformities bounding acoustically transparent rocks. The youngest, most profound unconformity cuts more deeply towards the center of the basin (east). Increasing water depths at Site 270 to hundreds of meters, and basinward-fanning of dips suggest thick ice was required for grounding, consistent with ice sheets sourced from West Antarctica rather than glaciers flowing off Central High islands. Low-resolution profiles best image Oligocene strata in the deep basin center, and cannot resolve features such as glacial flutes. Near the ice shelf edge, the basin fill thins onto Central High by onlap and erosion across a series of unconformities. In contrast, in the east a smooth, planar composite unconformity truncates the entire section, with syn-depositional thinning of ~30% of the 2 km-thick fill. This unconformity is younger than middle Miocene strata sampled near the top of DSDP site 272 and older than the early Pliocene rocks sampled near the bottom of DSDP Site 271. Deep basin strata were denuded by multiple cycles of erosion and isostatic rebound, and are now accessible to shallow shipboard or deeper ANDRILL ice shelf drilling. The same section outcrops on the western flank of Eastern Basin, both beneath the current ice shelf (pre-Miocene), and north of its edge. 193 Ongoing interpretations done after the end of the report period cover most of Ross Sea and provide evidence for the post-early Oligocene subsidence history of wide areas.",2008,2011
Brad Hacker,6/1/08,5/31/10,"$141,339 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,742451,Collaborative Research: Element Recycling from UHP Metasediments: Evidence and Consequences,We propose a study of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metasediments that have been subducted to >75 km to determine whether these rocks lost key trace elements during dehydration and/or melt extraction. Understanding the fluxes of material into and out of subduction zones is fundamental to understanding global geochemistry and a central goal of the MARGINS Initiative. Recycling efficiency (melt flux into arc crust/sediment flux into subduction zones) is as high as 75‚Äì80% for Th and > 30% for Ba and Be in the Central American arc for example [Plank et al. 2002; Morris and Ryan 2003]. In this study we will quantify processes that are responsible for this recycling. A commonly invoked hypothesis is that recycled Th Be and light rare-earth elements (LREE) from subducting sediments are transported into the mantle source of arc magmas in a melt because fluids below the aqueous fluid-saturated solidus contain negligible concentrations of Th Be and LREE. During the past five years >100 Fall AGU abstracts and >100 peer-reviewed papers have invoked a hypothetical sediment-melt component in arc magmas. Despite the importance of this hypothesis the residues of Th Be and LREE recycling from subducting metasediments have not been observed. It is by no means clear whether the melt-recycling hypothesis is correct and ‚Äì if it is ‚Äì under what PT conditions this happens. How does recycling occur beneath Central America? Natural rocks that have undergone subduction-zone metamorphism may record open-system fractional-dehydration and/or fractional-melting processes that are all but impossible to duplicate in the lab. In addition natural rocks have undergone modification at geological rates whereas it is difficult to extrapolate reaction kinetics from experimental conditions. We will focus on subducted metasedimentary rocks with the highest recorded pressures. These so-called ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) rocks reached pressures > 2 GPa. Most UHP rocks fall squarely within the bounds established by modern thermal models for ‚Äústeady state‚Äù subduction of oceanic crust and marine sediment in island arcs but we will also study samples that reached higher temperatures. To study UHP metasedimentary samples we will (1) use a consistent set of metamorphic reactions with mineral compositions from the literature and new analyses (2) collect new data for trace-element and isotope exchange thermometers and (3) use major-element oxygen isotope and geological field relations to identify metasediments. We will (4) measure trace elements in selected metasediments and compare them to the composition of fine-grained sedimentary rocks to identify systematic changes associated with melt extraction or dehydration. To interpret these changes and predict additional changes that could have occurred if our samples were carried to higher pressure and/or temperature we will (5) analyze trace elements in minerals in UHP samples ‚Äì to quantify mineral‚Äìmineral partitioning. Our study will yield vital constraints on the budget of key elements in subducting metasediments and the extraction of these elements via fluid and melt transport into the zone of magma genesis beneath arcs. For example a key outcome of this research might be confirmation that Th and Be are mainly retained in UHP metasediments up to the breakdown of minor phases such as zircon and allanite during melting.,2008,2010

Frank Spera,7/1/08,6/30/12,"$250,448 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,810127,Collaborative research: Testing models that describe the origin of compositional diversity of subduction zone magmatism Aeolian Islands,"Volcanic rocks integrate the records of crustal and mantle processes that govern the compositional diversity of magmas on Earth. At shallow-levels, recharge, crustal assimilation, and fractional crystallization (RAFC), as well as the temperature-pressure conditions of ascent, and composition(s) of surrounding crust dominate development of compositional diversity. In the mantle, particularly in subduction zones, melts acquire their characteristics from the intricate interplay of source composition (including slab- and sediment-derived fluids, sediments and their associated partial melts), intensive parameter constraints (e.g., P, T, fO2) and the style and extent of melting. Despite much study and hundreds of important contributions on these topics, challenges remain. Among these are quantification of RAFC and partial melting processes using geochemical computational tools now available that simultaneously address major and trace element, phase equilibria, and isotopic constraints, and the testing of quantitative predictions by exploiting advances in laboratory methods for textural and in situ chemical and isotopic analyses of crystals, glass and melt inclusions. We propose to explore these challenges by studying subduction zone volcanism of the Aeolian Islands, Italy. We have two primary objectives: (1) For selected suites of volcanic rocks from Alicudi, Filicudi and Salina, test the efficacy of the Magma Chamber Simulator (which has combined the capabilities of MELTS and Energy-Constrained Recharge, Assimilation, Fractional Crystallization) for modeling the compositional evolution from basalt to dacite by generating quantitative models that reproduce published major and trace element and Sr isotope trends. Model results will provide predictions about the compositions and abundances of melt+minerals along open-system liquid lines of descent. With the framework provided by these models, we propose collection of selected suites of rocks followed by acquisition of new textural and in situ (major element by electron probe, trace element by laser ablation ICPMS, and microsampled Sr isotopes) data of crystals, glass and melt inclusions. These new data will be evaluated in context of MCS results to explore two fundamental questions: (a) Is the MCS an effective modeling tool for complex systems? (b) What can we learn about the structure and dynamics of magma bodies associated with these islands? (2) Develop thermal models of the subducted slab and mantle wedge and, in conjunction with phase equilibria constraints (Perple_X and pMELTS), constrain the range of intensive thermodynamic variables relevant to mantle wedge partial melting. Then, based on a Monte-Carlo approach, using pMELTS, we will forward model (1) the composition of wedge partial melts by varying source composition, pressure, fO2, H2O content and style of melting, and (2) using the compositions of these melts, explore compositional changes that occur as melts ascend polybarically and partially crystallize. Best results from this two-stage approach will inform trace element analysis, which will apply published mineral-melt-fluid partition coefficients to closed system melting and crystallization equations for fluid-saturated systems. 197 Model data will be compared with major and trace element and phase equilibria data of the most mafic samples identified on Alicudi, Filicudi and Salina. The fundamental question being explored is what are the dominant controls on parental magma compositions in this subduction setting? Novel aspects of our proposed work include using innovative (but tested) computational models to simultaneously model major and trace element ± Sr isotopes variations in complex magmatic suites. Predictions about characteristics of components of volcanic rocks—crystals, glass, melt inclusions—are tested by taking advantage of recent innovations in textural and in situ data analysis. The end result of this marriage of state-of-the-art petrologic tools is testable models of how magmas form and evolve. If this approach is successful, it will impact how petrologists approach studying complex magmatic systems and will also provide a methodology by which source to surface compositional diversity can be understood by combining computational and analytical methods.",2008,2012
Douglas Burbank Bodo Bookhagen,7/1/08,7/31/14,"$280,000 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,819874,Collaborative Research: Orogeny orography and unsteady erosion: evolution of the Himalaya,Many aspects of climate-erosion-tectonic interactions remain unresolved. This research attempts to understand how Himalayan rates of erosion vary as a function of space and time and what drives such changes. Some detrital cooling-age data suggest that irrespective of how spatially irregular erosion may be at short time scales erosion rates become much steadier at longer time scales. This research will test that contention. The PIs hypothesize that at decadal to millennial scales spatial variations in rainfall distributions modulate differences in erosion rates. Specific stream power (the product of discharge and channel gradient) is hypothesized to provide a reliable proxy for modern erosion rates. To underpin tests of these hypotheses the PIs have developed and calibrated the highest resolution remotely sensed data on rainfall currently available for the Himalaya. When combined with digital topography rainfall is routed through the Himalayan landscape and predicts pronounced along-strike variations in stream power. To test whether stream power successfully predicts variations in erosion rates the PIs will collect 50 detrital cosmogenic nuclide samples within 10 catchments that exhibit strong contrasts in stream power. With judicious placement of sampling sites this large new data set should also permit testing of a much-debated question: is the rate of erosion controlled by large trunk rivers or by the erosive power of much smaller catchments (<20 km2) that cover most of the landscape? In order to assess the extent to which erosion rates change at longer time scales the PIs will collect relief transects of bedrock samples in each of the CRN-sampled catchments and will measure ~100 cooling ages each for apatite zircon and muscovite representing closure temperatures of ~80¬∞ ~200¬∞ and ~375¬∞C respectively. Reflecting different times and depths of cooling these ages will be analyzed using thermokinematic models to create reliable reconstructions of temporal changes in erosion rates at each of 10 catchments. Furthermore the PIs‚Äô current analysis suggests that topographic relief exerts a fundamental control on the distribution of Himalayan rainfall and that valleys of large rivers ‚Äúguide‚Äù moisture into the orogen. At time scales for which Himalayan topography and climate are ‚Äúconstant‚Äù spatial variations in rainfall stream power and hence erosion are therefore envisioned to remain steady. The Himalayas however are an active collisional orogen in which rocks advect laterally faster than they move vertically. The PIs hypothesize that topography also advects laterally especially in the rain shadow north of the Himalayan peaks where erosion rates appear lower. Moreover this advection is hypothesized to cause major re-organization of Himalayan drainages and related topography. If so new avenues for rainfall to move into the orogen will open old ones will close and as a consequence new patterns of erosion should emerge. As advection leads to stream capture and creation of new Transhimalayan rivers with greatly enhanced erosive power other trunk channels will be beheaded thereby losing power. Such changes in stream power should be expressed by changes in both erosion rates and topographic relief. The PIs propose to test these novel ideas by reconstructing changes in topographic relief using bedrock cooling ages both from their relief transects and from equal-elevation transects. Such dynamic Transhimalayan channels would stand in contrast to the persistence of rivers at the Himalayan ‚Äúindentor corners‚Äù. Despite the challenges presented by Himalayan landscapes they provide a propitious setting: stark lateral variations exist in rainfall erosion and topography; cooling ages are almost ubiquitously reset and strong signals of differential erosion should rise above the inevitable geomorphic and tectonic noise.,2008,2014
Brad Hacker,2/1/09,1/31/14,"$227,664 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,838264,Collaborative Research: Testing Channel-Flow Models Using Middle-Crustal Rocks of North Himalayan Gneiss Domes,Recently formulated thermal-mechanical channel flow/extrusion models which postulate that the middle crust exposed in the high Himalaya and southern Tibet was a low-viscosity ductile material bounded above and below by coeval normal- and thrust-sense shear zones respectively that flowed and extruded to the south. In light of these provocative models it is time to test the channel flow hypothesis by determining whether the predicted low-viscosity channel is exposed in the North Himalayan gneiss domes and whether it shows the expected combination of southward flow and vertical thinning. Flow within a channel can range from pure Couette flow to Poiseuille flow or be a combination of the two. Couette (or linear) flow develops between rigid plates moving relative to one another and is characterized by simple shear (high vorticity number) with the highest velocities toward the top or bottom of the channel. Poiseuille (or parabolic) flow develops between stationary rigid plates in which a horizontal gradient in lithostatic pressure produces the highest velocities in the center of the channel and decreasing but opposite shear velocities toward the top and bottom of the channel. Poiseuille flow is characterized by high vorticity number (simple shear) at the top and bottom of the channel decreasing vorticity number (mix of simple shear and pure shear or general shear) toward the center of the channel and low vorticity number (pure shear) at the center of the channel.This project will document the deformation vorticities finite strain temperatures and timing during ductile flow combined with existing thermobarometric geochronologic and thermochronologic data will provide a comprehensive spatial thermal and temporal history of deformation and flow in middle crustal rocks southern Tibet. Furthermore our studies combined with similar published and ongoing studies in middle crustal rocks exposed in the high Himalaya will provide an unprecedented view of middle crustal flow parallel to the transport direction over a distance of 50100 km. Characterization of deformation over a broad range of spatial thermal and temporal scales is critical to testing models of middle crustal channel flow/extrusion within a collisional orogen and will provide invaluable insight into the role of the middle crust in the geodynamic development of the HimalayanTibetaan orogenic belt and orogenic belts in general.,2009,2014
Douglas Burbank,7/1/09,9/30/13,"$282,370 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,838265,Controls on growth of the Puna Plateau NW Argentina,Both the mechanisms of growth of orogenic plateaus and the processes that control or limit their growth remain controversial. Within currently active orogens only two large-scale orogenic plateaus have developed during Cenozoic times. At the broadest scale their growth has been driven by sustained plate convergence. If such convergence continues into the future will these plateaus continue to expand? What controls whether they reach a stable size continuously expand or begin to shrink or collapse? This proposal focuses on the limits to outward growth of plateaus and the interplay between tectonic forcing and erosion that modulates changes in plateau margins. We focus on one mode of plateau growth: synchronous growth of thrust-related ranges with filling of high ponded intermontane basins that is hypothesized to be favored during times of relative aridity. The enhanced crustal loads represented by the basin-range couplet are proposed to drive outward propagation of deformation. Whereas this concept is not new few studies have tested the synchrony of thrusting basin filling and climate change. Little is known of the rates at which these processes occur or of the trade-offs that develop as climate and tectonics conspire to modulate active thrusting aggradation and erosion. Do rates of fault slip regulate base level and control when internal versus external drainages prevail? Or do changes in regional climate cause significant variations in rates of erosion and basin filling that in turn influence slip on nearby thrust faults? Do intermontane aggradational intervals correspond with times of outward propagation of the thrust belt or is increased aridity a key control or both? How do the style pace and rate of thrusting respond to pulses of sediment loading and removal? The answers to these questions will place valuable constraints on the viability of this ‚Äúrange and basin‚Äù model for plateau growth. Any test of the model requires excellent time control on a clearly delineated depositional and erosional history of intermontane basins and of the growing ranges to which they are potentially linked. We propose a study along the NE margin of the Puna Plateau and the adjacent Eastern Cordillera of NW Argentina. This region lies astride an abrupt climatic boundary and boasts multiple generations of late Cenozoic thrusting and basin filling and emptying. Successive faults overthrust alluvial strata and are then buried by younger gravels. Perhaps most importantly numerous volcanic ashes are preserved within the basin fills as well as within strata that are intricately interbedded with stacked sequences of thrust faults. These ashes promise to permit unprecedentedly tight time control on the growth and decay of this dynamic plateau margin and will underpin a detailed reconstruction of the interplay of range growth evolving fluvial networks and multiple cycles of basin filling and emptying. Ultimately a new temporally constrained view of the plateau margin will emerge from this study. The data collected in this study will permit us to assess the following hypotheses: 1) Range- building by active thrusting is coeval with aggradation in the intermontane basin on the hinterland side of the faults and is promoted by drier climatic conditions; 2) Outward growth of plateau margin can be stalled by breaching and erosion of intermontane basin-filling sequences; 3) Erosion of an intermontane-basin fill causes hinterland-stepping thrusting to restore topographic taper; and 4) A strengthened monsoon drives enhanced erosion and is temporally coincident with the breaching of intermontane basin fills. Our research effort will delineate the thrust-controlled growth of the Eastern Cordillera and the history of intermontane basin-filling in two basins that straddle the Puna Plateau‚Äôs margin. When synthesized with new chronologic data these will permit testing of the synchrony (or lack thereof) of changes in regional paleoclimate with changes in tectonics sedimentation and erosion across the plateau margin.,2009,2013

A major advance would be to understand the number sizes and histories of the various blocks that make up a UHP terrane. This proposal is to test whether UHP orogens form through repeated subduction of the same tectonic unit or through sequential subduction of different units by examining a specific example the Western Gneiss Region of Norway. Following careful petrology zircon genesis will be assessed by optical and back-scattered electron petrography cathodoluminescence trace-element abundances and Raman spectroscopy. Single grains and grain fragments will be analyzed by TIMS select populations by CA-TIMS and inherited cores by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Following reconnaissance SIMS dating single grains and grain fragments will be analyzed by TIMS. The strength of this approach lies in its use of state-of-the-art zircon geochronology and petrology collaboration with researchers at cutting-edge facilities and our familiarity with other ultrahigh- pressure orogens. The impact of this research should be considerable and broadly applicable because of the archetypal nature of the Norwegian UHP terrane.,2009,2012

It ruptured unilaterally about 250 km beneath the predominantly northeast-trending Longmen Shan a steep high mountain range that bounds the Tibetan Plateau to the northwest and the Sichuan Basin to the southeast. The strong ground shaking caused over 5 million buildings to collapse and nearly 70000 fatalities. The occurrence of this major earthquake surprised most of the geoscience community because the source region historically lacks large earthquakes and has a very low slip rate based on geological and geodetic data. Preliminary analysis revealed a highly complex rupture process where the seismic moment was roughly equally partitioned on the sub-parallel low-angle Pengguan and the high-angle Beichuan faults‚Äîa feature that has never been documented in the literature. This event has few large aftershocks which might be a common feature of large earthquakes in the Tibetan plateau and its vicinity though the reason for this is not clear. This catastrophic earthquake and its aftershock sequence will be investigated with seismic geodetic and geological observations. The rupture process will be constrained to match the tectonic background and surface observations and at the same time be consistent with rupture dynamics that includes a constitutive friction law. This research addresses the following questions: i) Are the rupture characteristics of this event different from other well studied thrust earthquakes such as 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake perhaps reflecting its abnormal tectonic loading process? ii) How could the thrust rupture initiate on the high angle Beichuan fault? What effect did the nucleation have on the subsequent rupture? iii) How did the ruptures on two faults dynamically interact? iv) What are the characteristics of the ground motion excited by this earthquake? Are the ground motions unusual compared with other large thrust events?,2009,2012

Recent work suggests that a pulse in ocean oxygenation ~580 million years ago may have permitted the evolution of animals, but almost no consideration has been paid to the relationship between biology and fluctuating oxygen levels earlier in the Neoproterozoic, in particular spanning the Cryogenian (a.k.a. ‘snowball Earth’) glaciations ~720 to 635 million years ago, when Earth may have been entombed in ice. The aim of this project is two-fold: (1) reconstruct oxygen levels and biology during the Cryogenian glacial interval; and (2) test the hypothesis that fluctuating oxygen levels are linked to changes in the diversity and composition of biological communities observed during this time. To address these goals, the Senior Personnel and their collaborators will undertake micropaleontological, geochemical, and geochronologic analyses of shales collected from successions in Svalbard, an archipelago north of Norway, and in four separate basins in Australia. Collectively, these units span the entire interval of Cryogenian glaciation. Samples from Svalbard have already been collected; samples from Australia will be collected during two field seasons, one in Tasmania, the other on the Australian mainland. All analyses will be performed on the same suite of stratigraphically well-defined samples, allowing records of life and oxygen availability to be unambiguously linked and placed within the context of Neoproterozoic climate change.",2009,2013

In metamorphic petrology the EPMA will be used to address key tectonic problems such as the exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure rocks melting of sediments in subduction zones flow of the lower crust and heating and cooling histories of xenoliths. It will also be used to address methodological issues such as linking thermobarometry and accessory phase chemistry to geochronology. In igneous petrology we will use the EPMA to understand magma-body dynamics through analyses of crystal zoning to test thermodynamic models of trace-element distributions and to understand magma PT paths through analysis of glass inclusions. In sedimentary petrology EPMA can be used to understand erosion and sediment transport during orogenesis and to understand surface processes and shallow-crustal deformation by providing a superior tuff-correlation tool. In geochronology a modern EPMA is central to making progress in using rutile as a thermochronometer characterizing the complexity of phases such as rutile and sphene prior to age determination interpreting U-Pb REE ages in light of garnet trace-element zoning understanding complex dissolution systematics and behavior during chemical-abrasion TIMS of zircon and monazite and in characterizing standards for laser-ablation ICPMS. In structural geology EPMA (and ICP) measurements of Ti in quartz will give us a previously unexploited means for assigning temperatures to deformation mechanisms. In geobiology EPMA may help break new ground in assessing how microbes acquire energy from sources physically bound or concealed in solids identifying intracellular inclusions in methanotrophs and identifying the imprint of anaerobic methanotrophs in the geologic record.,2009,2012
Chris Sorlien,9/1/09,11/30/12,"$49,999 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,929063,Collaborative Research: The North Anatolian Fault in the Marmara Sea Turkey: The Growth of Continental Transform Basins,"The 1500-km-long North Anatolian continental transform (NAF) accommodates westward motion of Anatolia relative to Asia at ~25 mm/yr. At its western end the NAF splinters into several strands with bends and jogs. These geometries and fault interactions are responsible for the extensional Marmara Sea trough, a composite Quaternary structure that includes three main basins with water depths >1200m, separated by submarine ridges. This boundary has been widely considered the type-transform for “pull-apart” structures, and the resulting Marmara basin is one of the best-studied transform basins in the world. Marmara is thus an ideal setting in which to address the following fundamental questions regarding transform basins: 1) What are the patterns of basin growth in space and time, and how do they relate to the deformation at depth? 2) Can the recent tectonic regime be extrapolated back to the onset of the sedimentary basins (i.e., steady- state tectonics), or have tectonics changed through time? 3) What are the geometries of major faults, and how is plate motion partitioned between them? 4) How are faults in Marmara influenced by pre-existing structures? The recent international focus on the Marmara Sea has led to shallow, very high-resolution seismic surveys that map the surface and near-surface traces of faults and sediment failures as well as deep penetration, low-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) surveys that image the deep basin and crustal structure. In July 2008, the proponents acquired >2700 km of high-resolution MCS reflection data throughout Marmara that fills the resolution gap between those datasets. The TAMAM (Turkish- American Marmara Multichannel) Project was funded by NSF in 2003, but was delayed by scheduling difficulties. In 2008, the proponents used the science budget to lease the R/V K. Piri Reis, operated by Dokuz Eylül University (DEU) in Izmir. Two additional days will be collected in Summer 2009. This dataset ties the faults at depth to their shallower structure where they interact with gravity-collapse and sedimentation patterns, and is thus ideal to resolve the pattern of growth in the basins. Processing and interpretation are ongoing together with our Turkish collaborators at DEU and Istanbul Technical University (ITU), within the constraints of our depleted science budget. This research will continue analysis and interpretation of TAMAM and other datasets to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of Marmara in the last ~1 Ma and to address the questions above. More advanced processing and detailed stratigraphic and structural interpretations of existing seismic data will be undertaken to determine the times at which different fault systems were active, slip rates on major faults, and the stratigraphic response to tectonics and climate. These observations can be used to quantify slip partitioning and changes in tectonics through time. Initial inspection of the TAMAM data indicates that downslope motion and gas are common throughout the basin, and their distribution will be mapped in order to assess their importance in 194 filling the basin and their response to tectonics. Pre-stack depth migration (PSDM) will also be applied to select profiles from the deep-penetration Seismarmara survey to obtain better estimates of fault geometry. Finally, isostatically-balanced kinematic reconstructions will be performed using the mapped sequences to test the predicted subsidence and sedimentation patterns arising from competing models for fault configuration at depth.",2009,2012

The link between predictions from the numerical modeling and the data resulting from real earthquakes must be strengthened. Observations of natural faults and faulting that emerge from geological and seismological studies as well as those from laboratory tests open new questions and point out new challenges. A primary task is to reconcile these observations with physical models of the earthquake source. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together the various researchers from the Americas Asia and Europe who use numerical simulations to investigate dynamics of earthquake ruptures as well as those who have used data to infer the nature of earthquake ruptures. While not mutually exclusive the union of the two sets of investigators is certainly greater than the intersection. A fundamental question that looms over both sets of investigators is what can the data (seismic geodetic geologic laboratory) tell us about the rupture dynamics? Similarly what predictions from different physical descriptions of rupture dynamics are observable?,2010,2011

Intellectual Merit: We propose to develop and evaluate the performance of a novel profiling buoy system for the calibration of satellite ocean color observations and the validation of their data products. This measurement capability is essential for creating longterm satellite climate data records of the ocean biosphere – but the costs of building and deploying existing moored buoy systems are excessive ($M’s to build & ~$1M/y to deploy for each site). Our system, the Near Surface Profiling Buoy (NSPB), will autonomously collect 100’s of high-quality, near-surface irradiance / radiance profiles during each multi-day deployment as part of a standard oceanographic research 181 cruise. The NSPB is built upon recent advances in optical profiling instrumentation designed for turbid water environments that is adapted to the calibration and validation of ocean color satellite data. The NSPB system is aimed at making day-long to week-long deployments improving the likelihood of high quality match-ups with satellite data than is possible with conventional profiling techniques. This will alleviate wire time constraints for shared research cruises, maximizing the return on research vessel time (often >$50K/day). The NSPB will be a cost- effective alternative to long-term, moored optical buoy installations for satellite ocean color sensor calibration and eliminates the need for addressing biofouling and extrapolation of subsurface signals to the sea surface, which are the major sources of uncertainty for long-term moored systems. We will test and deploy the NSPB system in both coastal and open ocean conditions as part of on-going UCSB research projects in the Santa Barbara Channel (PnB) and the Sargasso Sea (BBOP). System performance will be assessed and compared with traditional long-term moored buoy systems and conventional ship-based spectroradiometry profiling. All radiometric measurements will be fully characterized and tied to NIST standards and system radiometric performance will be monitored at UCSB. Broader Impacts: This equipment development will help reenergize long-term field research programs conducted by the UCSB group. More importantly, it will help solve a national need for a low-cost, high-performance, flexible buoy system for the calibration and validation of satellite ocean color observations. This development project has the potential to greatly improve the accuracy of present and future satellite ocean color sensors, which will have impacts far beyond this instrumentation development request. It will also involve a significant collaboration between academic researchers and the private sector that will advance the state of the art in optical technology and facilitate acquisition of quality data and instrumentation for long-term records of the ocean biosphere.",2011,2014

Because both monazite and allanite are compositionally variable and SIMS LA-ICP-MS incur instrumental mass-dependent fractionation it is essential to closely match standards with unknowns. This proposal seeks to determine isotope dilution (ID) Th-Pb ages for the Th-rich accessory minerals monazite and allanite. Th-Pb ages currently exist for only one reference material that is commonly used-'554'. Consequently all standard-based geochronologic measurements require an assumption that Th-Pb and U-Pb ages are equivalent. This assumption is unnecessary and in many cases invalid. By obtaining high-precision ID Th-Pb ages for a suite of well-characterized community-wide reference materials this research will provide a means of independently calibrating Th-Pb ages for minerals that can be linked to fundamental tectonic processes.,2011,2014
Douglas Burbank Bodo Bookhagen,8/1/11,7/31/15,"$275,006 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1050070,The Pamir Frontal Thrust System: Rates Style and Controls on Deformation,Our goals include defining how where and at what rates shortening has been accommodated within the Pamir-Tian Shan structural corridor and exploring the extent to which erosion by an axial river modulates shortening rates on faults proximal to the river. We will focus our work along the axis of the structural corridor where we can examine a rich suite of along- strike structural variability in the style orientation and (likely) rate of deformation. The Pamir Frontal Thrust (PFT) is the leading edge of the Pamir orogen. In reality some apparently Pamir-related faults occur to the north of the PFT including nearby faults that ruptured in the 1985 M7.4 Wuqia earthquake [Feng et al. 1988]. Within the study area the PFT tends to be localized within lower Paleogene gypsum beds and it typically carries the entire Cenozoic stratigraphic succession (up to 8 km thick) in its hanging wall. Where the PFT is exposed in the Bozi Tage Range near the Kezilesu River it tends to be a low-angle thrust dipping from 0¬∞ to 15¬∞. Ongoing slip on the PFT is evidenced by offset talus slopes that show fresh scarps. Typically the PFT slices across the Xiyu conglomerate an upper Cenozoic time-transgressive fluvial conglomerate that ranges in age from 16 to 0 Ma within the foreland [Heermance et al. 2007] but which is less than 1.6 Ma where it has been paleomagnetically dated a few kilometers north of the PFT in the corridor [Chen et al. 2005]. On the eastern margin of the Mayikake Basin the PFT cuts nearly horizontally across a 50¬∞-dipping 3-km-thick panel of Xiyu conglomerate for about 4 kilometers.,2011,2015

Second, we will use the information gained in this first part of the project to plan and carry out a sampling and measurement scheme most likely to yield a record of centennial variability in 10Be fallout flux that can be matched to the 10Be flux record from the Greenland ice cores. Measurement of bulk 10Be in NAVC sediments: The specific analytical tasks in this project include locating and obtaining samples of NAVC sediments, subsampling them for 10Be analysis, and measuring 10Be concentrations by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Our primary source of samples will be an extensive archive of cores of NAVC sediments that PI Ridge has collected over many years and that are stored at Tufts University. One important aspect of this part of the project, however, is to ensure that subsamples are not cross-contaminated, or contaminated with modern 10Be, during collection. This requirement may restrict use of archived cores that are highly fractured or otherwise difficult to sample cleanly. If we can not obtain the samples we need from this archive, we will revisit source outcrops and collect new samples, typically by collecting short cores from outcrops using a hammered-PVC-pipe procedure that Ridge has employed for many years. Ridge will have primary responsibility for locating archived and new sample material and correlating it to the NAVC, although students will also be closely involved in this process and all project personnel will participate. 10Be concentrations are measured by an isotope dilution method in which a 9Be carrier is added to the sample, the entire sample is digested and the Be extracted, and the Be isotope ratio is measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). All aspects of this process are proven, reliable, and efficient. We will carry out Be extraction from sediments in a purpose-built 159 chemistry laboratory at the University of Vermont (see Facilities and Resources), using a total- fusion method described by Stone (1996) and further refined during the past few years by Balco, Bierman, and Bierman’s students. At the 10Be concentrations we expect to measure in this project (> 107 atoms g␣1), AMS measurement is rapid (a few minutes per sample) and precise (␣1-2% analytical uncertainty). Research focus 1: systematics of 10Be deposition in varved sediments. We will use several strategies in the first part of the project. First, we will investigate how 10Be is delivered to glacial and nonglacial varved sediments. We hypothesize that 10Be deposition is seasonally focused due to effects such as more effective scavenging by fine sediment during winter, suppression of fallout 10Be delivery to the lake during winter due to snow and ice cover, and the strong overall seasonality of sediment transport and deposition. We will investigate this by characterizing 10Be concentrations and their variability within both summer and winter layers to investigate seasonal effects, as well as laterally within a single varve to investigate the effect of sediment source variation between direct glacial sediment and runoff from the landscape. Understanding which, if any, of these processes are important may suggest means to preferentially sample fallout 10Be rather than recycled 10Be. Second, we will determine whether or not short-period solar variability, in particular the diagnostic 11-year Schwabe cycle, is present. As noted in many ice- core studies (Beer et al., 1994; Yiou et al., 1997; Steig et al., 1998), observing the 11-year cycle in a 10Be concentration record clearly shows that 10Be fallout variations are recorded (the reverse is not necessarily true: if we did not observe the 11-year cycle, it could signal only that it was suppressed by a multi-year residence time for fallout 10Be in the lake and catchment, which would not affect recording of centennial-scale variability). Analytical work for this part of the project will require approximately 90 10Be measurements, including paired summer and winter analyses on a number of glacial and nonglacial sections (approx. 40 analyses) and analyses of at least two short continuous sections at a resolution adequate to observe the 11-year period (e.g., two-year spacing over a 50-year period; 50 samples). Research focus 2: generating a long 10Be flux record suitable for correlation. In the second part of the project we will choose a section of the NAVC from which to generate a long 10Be record with resolution appropriate to matching the centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux observed in the Greenland ice cores, and then generate this record. At present, absent any new information we may gain from the first part of the project described above, we think the nonglacial varve section at Newbury is the most likely section of the NAVC to yield such a record, for three reasons. First, varves are relatively thin, which limits dilution of the fallout signal. Second, centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux during this time interval are suitable for correlation at the needed precision, as demonstrated by Muscheler et al. (2008). Third, this section is one of the longest continuous sections in the NAVC, which permits us to generate as long a record as possible from a single site: this avoids any potential complications related to patching together 10Be records from multiple locations within the lake system.",2011,2014

In addition to the highly seasonal summer rainfall winter precipitation is important for snowmelt and discharge in the pre-monsoon (spring) season. Runoff from snow is especially significant in the central Asian and western Himalayan regions where hundreds of millions of people reside but observation understanding and prediction of terrestrial water storage and fluxes remain poorly understood. Quantification of seasonal amounts of rain snow glacial and snowmelt waters and associated physical processes are largely unknown despite their importance to pre-monsoon and dry-season water for irrigation drinking and power generation. The main goal of this project is to advance our current understanding of climate processes on regional-to-continental scales and how they affect the water balance in the High Asia Mountains. The project focuses on multiannual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and winter western disturbances (WD) and their impacts on rainfall snow and runoff variability in High Asia. The project will focus on three specific objectives: I. Characterize and investigate multi-annual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances and their regional impacts on the surface water budget in the High Asia Mountains.

James Frew,8/1/13,7/31/16,"$250,364 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,1302236,III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Citing Structured and Evolving Data,Citation is an essential part of scientific and scholarly publishing: it is used to gauge the trust placed in published data and for better or worse is an important factor in judging academic reputation. Now that much scientific publishing ‚Äì especially data publishing ‚Äì takes place through a database rather than conventional journals how should something that is found in a database be cited? More generally how should digital data that is stored in a repository with internal structure and which is subject to change be cited? This is the case for the very large number of curated databases through which much scientific publishing now takes place; it is also true of most scientific data collections which are seldom stable. There has recently been substantial interest in the problem of data citation and various organizations have proposed structures for the format and content of citations; however most proposals do not address issues of structure and change that are intrinsic to databases. The focus of this proposal is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the following issues: (1) the potentially very large number of possible citations; (2) citations should be both human and machine readable; and (3) citations must conform to specifications prescribed by both the publishers of the data and by the various standards that are being established. All these give rise to interesting computational challenges: citations must be generated automatically from the data; the source data must be guaranteed to support the generation of these citations; and the generated citations must be guaranteed to conform to the specifications. Of course as with any computational problem all this must be done efficiently. Citation is also closely related to provenance and issues of reproducible results. Workflows executable papers and microcitations have all been proposed to support reproducible analysis of data. The work of this project will explore the connections between these ideas and where possible establish a common framework. For many databases the publishers and authors have a clear idea of how they would like their data to be cited and there is enough information in the database to enable these citations to be generated once the right computational machinery has been developed. However interesting questions arise when a set of data to be cited is arrived at by means of a query in which case the query itself may need to be included (an actionable citation). In other cases the navigational structure needed for meaningful citation ‚Äì such as in the case with linked open data or RDF which are ostensibly large amorphous graphs ‚Äì may be missing. The challenge here is to find techniques for discovering or adding that structure to provide the necessary basis for citation.,2013,2016
J. Carter Ohlmann,12/1/08,3/31/12,"$146,651 ",Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Federal agencies,1360271,Impact of NASA Satellite Data and Models on U.S. Coast Guard's Decision Support Tool for Search and Rescue in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean,"A drifter study is being proposed for a quantitative indication of horizontal advection and diffusion processes in the study region over a wide range of time and space scales. Drifters provide a direct measure of transport pathways taken by surface water parcels. In addition, dispersion values are accurately obtained from drifter data by considering the relative motion of drifter pairs. Finally, drifter data can quantify sub-grid-scale motions averaged in H.F. radar fields, and provide a means for quantifying trajectories determined from both Eulerian data (i.e. H.F. radar) and numerical models. The primary goals of the proposed drifter work are: ● observe the eddy energy on scales not resolved by HF radar ● validate HF radar derived velocities ● quantify the skill of trajectories determined from numerical models Data from a set of drifting buoys, or drifters, will be collected and used to achieve the project goals. A total of 12 drifters will be repetitively deployed in a variety of configurations so as to achieve the project goals during the ~2 week intensive sampling program. The first sampling configuration (hereafter “small scale deployment”) will involve placing all 12 drifters uniformly within a 1x1 km HF radar grid cell. As the drifters leave the box, they will be retrieved and redeployed so as to maintain a nearly uniform distribution throughout the box. This sampling configuration will give in situ time and space average surface current values over the same scales as observed with HF radar, thus allowing for validation HF radar data and quantification of the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) that exists on sub HF radar scales (i.e. Ohlmann et al 2007). 149 Knowledge of the quality of HF radar data and the aliased energy are crucial parameters that must accompany assimilation of HF radar data in numerical models. The second sampling configuration (hereafter “large scale deployment”) will involve successive deployment of clusters of 3 drifters throughout a day. The drifters will be left to sample the circulation for roughly 3 days, or until it appears they are near beaching or exiting the sound. This sampling configuration will give in situ trajectories that can be used for quantifying skill of trajectories obtained from numerical model results. In addition, the data will give examples of how trajectories can change with small variations in the deployment time. Finally, computation of eddy diffusivity values on a number of scales from drifter pair separation statistics will provide direct observations of eddy motions that are parameterized in numerical models. Small scale deployments will occur within an HF radar grid cell located where radials are near orthogonal so as to avoid errors from geometric dilution of precision. This sampling configuration will be carried out for 1 day at the beginning, middle, and end of the observational period. Drifters will be drogued at a depth of 1 meter, close to integration depth of the radar which depends on HF radar operating frequency. Large scale deployments will occur during the first and second weeks of the intensive observational period so as to (presumably) capture flows during two unique synoptic events. Drogue depth, primarily at 1 meter, will be altered on one of the cluster releases to look at variation in the effect of wind drift with depth. This will be especially useful for model validation which assimilates surface data and predicts subsurface values. A recent study shows the significance of vertical shear in the horizontal current field over the top few meters of the ocean on determination of trajectories (French McCay et al. 2007) High resolution Microstar drifters are proposed. The recently developed Microstar (Ohlmann et al. 2005) records its position with GPS and transmits the position data to a host computer using the Iridium satellite communications network. Data transmission is near real-time allowing drifter positions to be monitored from any computer with internet access. Position data, sampled every 10 minutes, is accurate to within ~10 m. The sampling frequency provides a high signal-to- noise ratio even in small velocity regimes. The spatial accuracy and near real-time transmission enables drifters to be recovered and redeployed. The Microstar uses a collapsible scaled-down tri-star type drogue with a drag-area-ratio greater than 41 that is centered at ~1 m depth. Slip is ~0.1% of the wind speed (~1 cm/s in 10 m/s of wind) which is typical of modern-day drifters. The Microstar is appropriate for the proposed work for a number of reasons. First, it has extremely high spatial and temporal resolution, required to resolve the small scales of motion that characterize coastal flows.",2008,2012

Ralph Archuleta,1/1/11,12/31/12,"$72,170 ",US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,10600014,Strong Ground Motions in Salt Lake City and Other Metropolitan Areas From Large Earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault,Nearly 80% of the population of Utah lives near the Wasatch fault (Utah Geological Survey 1996). The metropolitan areas of Salt Lake City and Provo/Orem are among the most hazardous regions of the United States (USGS 1998). Besides the question: When will the next large earthquake occur? The most important question is: What will the ground motion be? Large earthquakes even moderate sized events are relatively rare on the Wasatch fault. The geological setting‚Äîwhere most of the infrastructure and the population are sitting on alluvial filled valleys‚Äî exacerbates the situation. We propose to mitigate the seismic risk by using dynamic and kinematic simulations of different earthquake scenarios to derive estimates of the expected ground motion from large earthquakes on the Wasatch fault. These simulations will account for: 1) geometry of the fault 2) the velocity structure in particular the 3D structure with sediments juxtaposed against the granite of the mountains 3) topography 4) heterogeneous stress on the fault and 5) physics of the constitutive laws for friction. Many different earthquake scenarios based on different hypocenters and variations of the input parameters will be simulated in order to determine the range of the ground motion. These simulations will provide ground motion for frequencies up to 1-2 Hz. We will make use of the extensive investigations already done for the Wasatch fault that document the geometry of the fault active tectonics and the velocity and attenuation structure. Recent USGS funded projects will provide more details about the 3D velocity structure as well as the near-surface velocities for some limited regions. Professor Robert Smith University of Utah has been either directly or indirectly involved with most of the studies that provide these basic data. We have used the 3D community velocity model and the USGS description of the fault geometry as the baseline for our simulations. We have incorporated these features in our initial simulations of the dynamics of a spontaneously propagating fracture. We use the finite element code MAFE [Ma and Beroza 2008; Ma and Archuleta 2006; Ma et al. 2007] to simulate dynamic ruptures on dipping faults. The dynamics includes heterogeneous stress conditions and a slip weakening constitutive law for friction that couples the heterogeneous stresses on the fault with the elastic response during a spontaneous shear fracture. While this method includes the realistic effects of geology fault structure and the physics of a spontaneously propagating shear fracture the ground motion is computationally limited to frequencies less than 1-2 Hz. To extend the frequency range to higher frequencies ~10-20 Hz we will collaborate with Professor Jacobo Bielak Carnegie Mellon University who has developed a hierarchical finite element method that can take our dynamic results of faulting as input to a kinematic model and propagate the motion to higher frequencies. With many different faulting scenarios there will be many different ground motion maps. The purpose of the project is to estimate the range of ground motion that should be expected from a MW ~7 earthquake on the Wasatch Fault. Preliminary results for normal faulting earthquakes show that the ground motion on the hanging wall (the side of the fault where most of population resides) has large ground motion and long duration due both to the proximity of the fault plane and the sediment filled basin. The largest amplitudes are within ¬±5 km of the fault trace with the largest amplitudes on the vertical component. Basically we have very limited direct knowledge of what to expect from a large normal-faulting earthquake. Through simulations of many scenario earthquakes that include realistic geological structure and fault geometries we will provide robust estimates for the expected ground motion from a MW~7 earthquake on the Wasatch fault.,2011,2012
Brian Clarke Douglas Burbank,9/1/12,8/31/15,"$171,556 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,12272278,Quantifying Near-Surface Patterns of Bedrock Fractures and Assessing Controls on Fracture Formation,Rock strength is a well recognized but poorly known variable in landscape dynamics. Such strength plays a key role in shaping landscapes resisting erosive processes and modulating landslide hazards. The key factor however is not the strength of intact rock but rather the effective strength of the entire rock-mass at the surface where it interacts with climatic topographic and biotic variables. This effective strength is modulated by the development of fractures that weaken the rock mass and make it more susceptible to erosion physical and chemical weathering biologic activity or collapse. We have recently developed a methodology using both shallow seismic refraction surveys bedrock outcrops and laboratory analyses of ‚Äúintact‚Äù samples to delineate variations in fracture density in the shallow subsurface. These new data indicate two common fracture patterns versus depth: rock that is uniformly fractured (apparently by large-scale tectonic forces); and rock with a distinct fracture gradient in an upper layer (apparently due to geomorphic fracturing processes have damaged the near-surface) that overlies a much stronger less fractured lower layer. Although very promising this methodology needs to be refined tested and explored more thoroughly.,2012,2015

In the United States such models are relevant to federally mandated management of wild animals by state-level agencies. We sampled birds during the breeding seasons of 2001‚Äì2009 with fixed-radius point counts. For each of 50 species we used boosted regression trees to model reporting rate (proportion of years a location was surveyed in which the species was present) as a function of covariates related to topography and current land cover and climate. To assess model fit we calculated the proportion of binomial deviance explained. We used cross-validation to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models. We applied program Zonation which was designed for spatial conservation prioritization to identify the set of cells that maximized summed reporting rates for multiple species through time given current land cover and two scenarios of land-cover change (expansion of pinyon‚Äìjuniper woodland and contraction of riparian woodland). Models based on the set of 13 covariates derived from remotely sensed data had some predictive capacity for 41 of 50 species. Models suggested little change in the spatial distribution of high-quality habitat for these species following projected expansion of pinyon‚Äìjuniper woodland. There were considerable differences among species with respect to variables that explained a high proportion of variation in reporting rates and in projected responses to different scenarios of land-cover change.,2009,2013

The questions were generated by an open inclusive process that included personal interviews with decision makers broad solicitation of research needs from scientists and policymakers and an intensive workshop that included more than 30 scientifically oriented individuals responsible for managing and developing policy related to natural resources. The process differed from previous efforts to set priorities for conservation research in its focus on the engagement of decision- makers in addition to researchers. The research priorities emphasized the policy relevance of addressing societal context exploration of trade-offs among alternative policies and actions and more-traditional questions related to ecological processes and functions. We then conducted a survey of natural resource policymakers managers and scientists to rank the research questions with respect to their applicability to policy. We received completed surveys from 602 respondents including 194 policymakers and 70 scientists from government 228 scientists from academia and 110 others. A question on water supply necessary to sustain human populations and ecosystem resilience was ranked as having the greatest potential to increase the effectiveness of policies related to management of natural resources in the United States.

Many areas of high energy potential are in fragile environments that are easily disturbed and hard to restore. Our understanding of impacts of energy projects and associated infrastructure is still in its infancy (Western Governors‚Äô Association 2008). Utility scale solar projects having less implementation track record than wind have potential impacts that are garnering increasing attention: habitat loss; alteration of water sources; elimination of crucial seasonal habitats; habitat fragmentation; disruption of movement patterns and connectivity and loss of gene flow; avoidance of project areas due to noise or human activity; invasive species that take advantage of disturbed sites; wildlife mortality on service roads; collisions or electrocutions from new transmission lines; or increasing predation as a result of additional prey perches on powerline poles (Western Governors‚Äô Association [WGA] 2008). Improvement in understanding is needed both about habitat-related effects and about cumulative impacts. By modeling the cumulative impacts from renewable energy development climate change and urban growth in the Western Mojave region Bare et al. (2009) were able to show where connectivity for desert tortoise and desert bighorn sheep would likely decrease. Avoidance behavior by wildlife of energy projects can lead to high energy costs to individuals from the cumulative effect when multiple projects occur along a species movement corridor (Fox et al. 2006). Each species however has different sensitivities to these habitat alterations. Adding to the uncertainty about specific impacts is the diversity of solar technologies. Some systems require high power towers at the center of the farm of heliostats. Tracking systems require greater spacing between rows of panels to avoid artificial shading. Habitat models that operate on the scale of these impacts have been missing but are now possible with recent advances in modeling. NEPA prescribes a mitigation hierarchy: avoid minimize restore or offset in descending order of preference. The bustle of planning activity for renewable energy in the West has focused on avoiding crucial habitats and minimizing impact on significant biological resources. The WGA has been assessing energy potential and wildlife impacts for several years. They established a process of selecting renewable energy zones (REZs). Sites of sufficient energy density were screened for statutory or regulatory limitations (e.g. designated wilderness areas) or general environmental or land use constraints. To rank these sites to inform the process of establishing REZs the Western Governors‚Äô Wildlife Council defined categories of High Sensitive Areas that are irreplaceable for wildlife Sensitive Areas where development would likely pose a significant risk to wildlife and Areas with Insufficient Data. NatureServe (2009) was contracted to map these sensitivity classes according to data and classification rules chosen by each state.,2011,2013
Hunter Lenihan,7/1/10,6/30/11,"$1,512 ",UC Sea Grant College Program,UC-wide,20101258,MPA-Based Collaborative Techniques to Improve Management of Nearshore Fisheries,Spatially structured data poor stocks are among the most valuable fisheries in California. Effective management of these stocks is suboptimal due to the lack of stock status indicators and unknown quantitative reference points. Stock assessments are the basic framework for computing stock status indicators yet many nearshore species lack the necessary data to perform traditional stock assessments. Moreover many stocks in the nearshore environment are governed by metapopulation dynamics (Gunderson et al. 2006) in which discrete populations are connected via larval dispersal (Kritzer and Sale 2004). For these species traditional coast-wide assessments are insufficient to account for differences in mortality rates growth rates reproductive patterns and harvest pressure between sub populations (Francis et al. 2008) thus reducing the potential to set harvest levels at predetermined target levels. The spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is an economically culturally and ecologically important species in California. During the 2007-‚Äô08 fishing season for example 167 active commercial permits landed 306t (metric) with an ex- vessel value of ~$7.22 million. A vigorous recreational fishery is also formed around this species and initial analyses of recreational report cards issued by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) suggest that this sector contributes significantly to the total catch. In December of 2009 the authors participated in a workshop convened by CDFG that outlined needs and objectives for completion of a stock assessment by December 2010. Stock assessment biologists and independent consultants (Marine Stewardship Council) have determined that estimates of fishing mortality natural mortality and growth rates are critical to performing a robust assessment of the spiny lobster resource. California‚Äôs nearshore finfish fishery targets multiple species using hook-and-line and trap gear. Although the total statewide volume of commercial landings in the nearshore groundfish fishery has been modest in recent years (224 tons landed commercially in California waters in 2006) many of theA(and net revenues of $2.2 million in 2006). Grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) is one of the predominantly landed stocks of the 19 species managed under the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan (Nearshore FMP 2002). Sufficient data to evaluate stock status of grass rockfish and a majority of the other species in the Nearshore FMP are unavailable and therefore the complex is managed using the precautionary approach (Restrepo et al. 1998). The Reauthorization of the Magnuson Act now requires the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for all US fisheries. To effectively set ACLs novel methods must be developed and utilized for these data poor species. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the California coast (MLPA) offers tremendous potential for managers to use these zones to guide decision making at local scales. No-take MPAs may serve as proxies for unfished populations at specific locations. By comparing MPAs to adjacent fished areas that experience similar environmental conditions it may be possible to calculate natural mortality and fishing mortality rates as well as design methods that set sustainable harvest levels at local scales. We have developed two novel methods for utilizing data from MPAs to inform fisheries management decisions for the nearshore and spiny lobster fisheries: (1) A decision tree model (Wilson et al. 2010) that can be used to set ACLs and (2) a length structured model that uses growth models and size structure data from inside and outside reserves to calculate rates of natural and fishery- imposed mortality. For spiny lobster the growth and mortality models developed in this proposal and the resulting outputs will be directly utilized in the upcoming stock assessment being performed by Doug Neilson of CDFG. We are in direct contact with Dr. Neilson and he has expressed a need for these data as soon as possible thus the urgency of this research is immediate. The decision tree-ACL model developed in this proposal and the recommended harvest levels for grass rockfish will be published in peer reviewed journals with the expectation of becoming a tool in the CDFG and NOAA Fisheries toolbox for setting ACLs which is also of immediate urgency. NOAA and CDFG stock assessment biologists with whom we collaborate (Alec MacCall ‚Äì NOAA Meisha Key ‚Äì CDFG) have expressed confidence that the decision tree- ACL model will be an accurate and practical tool for setting catch limits.,2010,2011

Ralph Archuleta,11/1/10,10/31/12,"$60,000 ",University of California,UC-wide,20110295,Peer NGA-EAST Finite Fault Simulations,We propose to compute ground motions from a kinematic source description that is based on correlated random distributions for the slip amplitude rupture velocity peak time (time of maximum sliprate) and rise time (duration of sliprate) on the fault (Schmedes et al. 2009). The distributions are determined from dynamic ruptures as are the correlations between slip amplitude rupture velocity and rise time (Schmedes et al. 2009). The method of using correlated random source parameters based on the work of Liu et al. (2006) is very flexible and can be easily modified to adjust to our evolving understanding of earthquake ruptures. This kinematic approach is similar then the one proposed by Liu et al. (2006) but instead of creating separate normal distributed fields as a starting point we propose to use a 4-dimensional Gauss distribution that is constructed using the covariance matrix of the normal score transformed parameters slip rise time peak time and rupture velocity. To account for the effect of scattering on the high frequency radiation pattern a frequency-dependent perturbation of azimuth dip and rake of each subfault is implemented similar to Pitarka et al. (2000). The complexity of the source process is represented by spatial distributions of randomized source parameters but the integrated characteristics of these parameters are constrained by the total seismic moment radiated energy and the high-frequency decay of the spectral amplitudes in the source spectrum. The ground motions can be computed in either a 1D (horizontally layered) or 3D viscoelastic structure. If a 3D structure is used only the low frequencies (f < ~1-2 Hz) are computed for that structure. A 1D structure with travel times consistent with the 3D structure is used for high frequencies. It needs to be emphasized that this method is not meant to give a single ground motion at a given station; it is meant to give a range of ground motions. We do not know the exact description of faulting for a future earthquake. We only know ‚Äîstatistically‚Äî the properties of past earthquakes. These properties are what we use in conjunction with the representation theorem and wave propagation to predict the range of ground motion at a given station or stations for a specified earthquake. We have validated this method against data from the Northridge and Loma Prieta earthquakes. We have also compared with Landers but have not incorporated a multi-segmented fault which is a much closer approximation to the actual rupture. The proposed method has already been implemented on the SCEC/USGS Broadband Platform.,2010,2012

Our collaborators at UC Berkeley (Max Moritz and postdoc) will evaluate cover changes (trees to shrubs) and their consequences in Sierran watersheds while the UCSB group will focus on southern California coastal mountain ranges and eco-hydrological modeling. At UCSB we will use a combination of historic aerial photos GIS and fire occurrence records to evaluate factors contributing to watershed conversion in order to project areas vulnerable to future change. To study the consequences of land cover change we will select relatively fine-scale study areas to be compared stratified according to those that are dominated by native species and those that have largely been ‚Äútype converted‚Äù into non-native invasive species. Local scale measurements of water infiltration vegetation evapotranspiration and soil surface conditions will be used to parameterize watershed scale models to predict changes in water yield and nitrate run-off relative to vegetation condition. Small scale measurements will be used to parameterize and test the ecosystem watershed model RhesSys to evaluate the potential for largescale changes in water yield due to land cover change.

With these new data, it is now possible to study the direct relationship between ground response and pore pressure generated by the same source. A suite of 20 events is available from liquefaction arrays, where pore pressure increases are observed and surface waves generate long-period response. Using wavelet decomposition, we propose to find a relationship between pore pressure and ground motion that includes the effects of long-period, cyclic signals. Preliminary analysis indicates that long-period motions have a 166 profound influence on pore pressure and thus must be included in a comprehensive survey of liquefaction hazard. The pore pressure response is sensitive to shear strain and peak velocity at low frequencies. The results of this study will provide a new risk assessment tool for the reduction of hazard due to liquefaction caused by large earthquakes. Data collected from recent events have demonstrated that pore pressure increase is a strain-based phenomenon that responds to long-period signals from surface waves well after the peak accelerations of an earthquake have passed. Saturated areas of western Oregon and Washington are particularly vulnerable to the effects of strong motions generated by Cascadia subduction zone events. With new data from recent events, we show that the cycles and sustained high velocities of surface waves have a dramatic effect on pore pressure increase, even in the absence of large accelerations.

Roland Geyer David Stoms,3/1/13,5/31/14,"$49,898 ",California Energy Commision,"California state, municipal agencies",20111479,Potential Rooftop Photovoltaic Electricity for Sustainable Transportation in California,Community sustainability is determined in part by meeting transportation needs with locally- produced low-carbon energy. We recently demonstrated that supplying biomass feedstock from crops in California would require vast commitments of land with mixed impacts on wildlife species and loss of food-producing land (Stoms et al. 2011). We also showed that using photovoltaics (PV) to directly convert solar radiation into electricity for electric vehicles would have dramatically lower direct land requirements than biomass-based pathways based on corn or switchgrass (Geyer et al. 2011). Even the most efficient biomass- based pathway in the US counties with the highest potential crop yields requires 29 times more land than the PV-based alternative in the same location. Using average US insolation all gasoline consumed in US transportation in 2009 could be replaced with 1.1 million hectares of cadmium telluride PV systems without competing with food for fertile land (Geyer et al. 2011). PV-based sun-to-wheels transportation is particularly attractive for California since it harnesses the state‚Äôs excellent solar resources while requiring virtually no water or other resources during operation. It has the potential to be a key element for sustainable communities since PV systems can be installed on rooftops and in brownfields. What is unknown is whether there is sufficient area of rooftops available to meet California‚Äôs potential electric fuel demand. Solar electric transportation is amenable to distributed generation. Separate research studies on the three primary components of solar electric transportation‚Äîsolar insolation rooftop area per household available for PV installation and driving patterns‚Äîhas shown that all three vary with the location or socioeconomic characteristics of the communities. In this study we propose to integrate these three separate themes to assess the potential capacity of distributed rooftop PV systems to meet community-scale demand for personal vehicle transportation across California. Solar insolation has been modeled and shows strong gradients with latitude and average cloud cover. Rooftop area has been shown to be related to housing density. We will use Census2000 housing data at the block group level to model rooftop area. Rooftop area will be adjusted with empirical data from a previous CEC-funded study to account for shading building orientation or protuberances such as chimneys and vents (Navigant Consulting Inc. 2007). Driving patterns in terms of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are also related to housing density (Brownstone and Golob 2009). We will apply our model of land area of PV per VMT for electric vehicles as a function of insolation (Geyer et al. 2011) to calculate the total surface area needed for PV panels to meet demand for solar transportation energy in a community. We will then determine the proportion of driving demand that could be supplied with PV systems across the state under the Renewable Portfolio Standard scenarios of adoption rates for electric vehicles. Total and available rooftop area will be validated with site-specific data where available (e.g. CH2M Hill solar maps). We will also estimate solar fuel cost per VMT based on industry figures for installed cost of PV for comparison with fossil fuel prices to determine how competitive PV is in individual communities. The geospatial results will be disseminated on a web map server where California ratepayers and sustainability planners will be able to see the overall potential for sun-to-wheels transportation in their communities. Electric vehicles distributors and solar PV installation firms can use this information to target communities with the greatest potential.,2013,2014

Support for an additional 1/2 year will allow him to complete his integration of CZO hydrologic data and coupled eco-hydrologic modeling of climate responses for the CZO watersheds (see papers in prep 1 through 4). Results from previous modeling analysis demonstrate shifts between temperature and water limited responses to climate warming across a combination of micro- climate, drainage-position and soil depth gradients defined by the CZO. We would like to extend this analysis to a broader regional scale. A large spatial extent would cover a larger elevational gradient and includes shifts in dominant conifer species. Results from this work will link analysis done at the CZO to a broader Southern Sierra context and several ongoing initiatives (NEON, and a recent NSF funded study to look at climate-forest establishment in this region). Recent studies across the Western US and elsewhere document increasing rates of background mortality and drought related forest dieback (Allen et al., 2010). We expand our data-model integration to examine how site specific geoclimatic characteristics mediate the vulnerability of forests to these disturbances. We build on recent work demonstrating the application of RHESSys for a Ponderosa Pine forest in New Mexico where model accurate estimated spatial patterns of dieback during the early 2000s drought. We will estimate spatial patterns of drought-related mortality in the Southern Sierra CZO and examine where and under what conditions threshold responses are most likely to occur. This work will build on prior modeling and data collection at the CZO. We seek to fund a second PhD student for 1/2 year. By providing overlap between past- CZO student, Khongho Son, in the Tague Ecohydrology Lab and a new student we facilitate technology transfer. Key tasks in this analysis will be a) improved data assimilation of existing vegetation data sets, including LIDAR data, flux tower, and allometric measurements into the model to provide a more realistic baseline of existing vegetation carbon stores and b) parameterization of RHESSys estimates of vegetation drought responses across a range of species and soil characteristics within the CZO. We link this project with another ongoing USGS project - the Western Mountain and incorporate tree-ring and C13 isotope measurements in the Southern Sierra region as additional data to validate and parameterize our model. To drive RHESsys we use state-of-the art downscaling of GCM scenarios from Flint et al (2010) to 800m. GCM scenarios include downscaled NCAL, GFDL and PCM models.

Develop better models of friction in fault gouge through reformulation of the STZ theory in terms of concepts more appropriate for strictly granular systems (perfectly hard spheres) in which there is no intrinsic energy scale to extract the broad spectrum of transition rates and trapping volumes and to capture inherent variability arising from the broad range of grain sizes in fault gouge. Develop a multi-scale approach to the dynamic rupture problem through the resolution of dynamics that arise from these constitutive laws and the material properties of the fault gouge to obtain predictive results for dissipation and fracture from laboratory to tectonic scales. Assess the heat flow paradox through the analysis of energy balance and thermal heating during large earthquakes based on general thermodynamic principles as well as specific information regarding the materials and failure mechanisms that occur in faults.

The primary focus is to estimate the relative contribution of on and off-fault dissipation mechanism to the total energy budget. We will start by investigating the conditions under which a steady slip pulse can propagate on a velocity- weakening friction interface embedded in an elasto-plastic bulk. Steady propagation will allow us to examine the relationship between the width of the plastically deforming zone surrounding the fault and the constant width of the slip pulse. Because steady propagation does not emit radiated energy accurate bounds can be placed in this case on the energy dissipated in the inelastic and frictional processes. Steady propagation will also allow us to investigate in a more systematic way the effect of perturbations in the material properties material response and prestress on the rupture dynamics including variability in rupture speed maximum slip rate and ultimately rupture arrest. We will also address several seismologically-relevant questions. For example we will be examine the effect of off-fault plasticity on seismic observables like rupture speed acceleration to limiting speed in sub-shear ruptures transition to super shear and slip rate functions (in terms of the maximum and the average values of slip rates). Moreover we will also be able to assess the impact of off-fault dissipation on the high frequency content of ground motion. This is relevant for developing physically-based models for ground motion prediction. The project will accomplish the following tasks: a. Quantify the magnitude of on- and off-fault dissipation and their relative contribution to the earthquake energy budget for different friction laws (rate and state law/slip weakening law). b. Constrain the absolute levels of prestress consistent with the different modes of ruptures (cracks vs pulses) with and without the presence of off-fault dissipation mechanisms. c.

Prior studies of surface waters in this creek have focused on quantifying culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) but FIB are neither specific to fecal material nor specific to human waste and thus cannot be used for definitively determining if human fecal material is a contributing factor to microbiological water quality. The Holden Lab at UCSB was contacted by representatives of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians (SYBCI) and solicited to perform this research. The basis for soliciting the Holden Lab is prior experience with characterizing microbiological water quality using modeling (Steets and Holden 2003) DNA-based (Field Chern et al. 2003; LaMontagne and Holden 2003; Sercu Van De Werfhorst et al. 2009) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based (unpublished) approaches.

Thomas Dunne,3/14/13,10/30/13,"$49,960 ",California Department of Water Resources,"California state, municipal agencies",20130814,Analysis of the Potential for Gravel Augmentation in the Robinson Reach Merced River,The original planning of the Merced River Salmon Habitat Enhancement Project in the Robinson Reach of the river considered the possibility of gravel augmentation some unspecified number of years after project construction in order to sustain habitat benefits designed into the original project and to help offset channel and floodplain incision which might lead to channel braiding. A supply of gravel was stockpiled along the floodplain margin to support such management activity whenever it became desirable. In the approximately ten years since project construction the project reach has undergone some bed topographic changes (growth of point bars and the deepening of pools undercutting and migration of some river banks excavation of shallow depressions across the floodplain) changes in the grain size of bed material and the partial colonization of the floodplain by various types of plants. Habitat values are gradually evolving as a result of these changes. The flow regime that has caused channel changes during the post-construction decade has been dominated by several managed releases from the New Exchequer Dam. Most of the changes in channel morphology and grain size occurred in three overbank flows (2005 2006 and 2011) that extended entirely across the floodplain and lasted for several weeks each. These changes involved the development of point bars and the related shifting of maximum scour locations. Peak discharges ranged up to the equivalent of a 5-year flood in the regulated flow regime but the duration of these flow releases produced more sediment transport and channel change than would have been expected in three natural shorter floods. Bankfull and smaller flows did not transport significant volumes of sediment although some local changes of bed elevation occurred in the first year after construction while the bed was still in a loosely packed state. After ten years of project functioning it is appropriate to assess the nature of changes that have occurred in the form and functioning of the project site as they relate to channel stability and habitat values. There is also a need to better understand the extent to which adding gravel might alter rates of bar building bank migration and enhancement of salmon habitat in the reach. In particular it is possible to estimate what might be accomplished through gravel augmentation using the stockpiled gravel resource which has a particular volume and grain-size composition or with a modified gravel resource. The investigation will deliver: (i) A summary and assessment of channel changes during the first ten years of project operation (ii) A set of computer simulations of the effects on channel morphology and migration bed texture and the flow-field characteristics of salmon habitat to be expected from gravel augmentation under a range of conditions (augmentation rate grain- size composition and flow regime),2013,2013

We will also test a broader range of technology and policy scenarios and identify policy instruments that help promote renewable energy technologies. Our first step is to build an integrative model centered on a system dynamics framework, coupled with life cycle inventories (LCIs) of various renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies. In so doing, we will capitalize on our previous USDA/DOE project, in which we integrated system dynamics model with life cycle assessment (LCA) to identify cost-effective pathways to achieving the national Renewable Fuel Standard (see http://forio.com/simulate/umn/rfs2/simulation). Another major source of data will be our ongoing project on low-carbon energy technologies including wind, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, geothermal, hydropower and carbon capture and storage. Under this project LCIs of renewable energy technologies and other low-carbon energy technologies are compiled, and they are connected to different policy scenarios that mitigate 208 greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 to 2050. This model accounts for technology change and changing energy mix over time, but the model does not currently interact with policy interventions. Coupling the data and results acquired from this project with a system dynamics model will enable us to simulate different policy and technology scenarios. The data and the model that have been compiled so far do not include those of shale gas development. Therefore, after construction of the integrative model, we will add the component of shale gas and develop an array of technology and policy scenarios to simulate potential influences that rising shale gas production would exert on the rest of the energy sector, particularly on renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, the scenario development will help us identify policy measures that can lead to least cost, least greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A preliminary list of scenarios worth exploring include (1) continuous increase in shale gas in the mid to long run (baseline), (2) nation-wide implementation of a California’s low carbon fuel standard (LCFS), (3) carbon tax on fossil energy, (4) federal and state subsidies and credits for low-carbon technologies, and (5) relief of control over natural gas export largely to emerging countries like China and India to replace their coal combustion, which would boost U.S. economy but likely bring domestic natural gas prices back pre-shale gas situations.",2013,2015

Our study will be conducted in the Himalaya and is focused on these goals: to explore potential linkages between climate erosion and tectonics in a very active collision almountain belt; to define spatial and temporal variations in monsoonal precipitation along and across strike as a function of both topography and typical storm tracks; to quantify erosion-ratevariationsat10^3-to10^6-yr time scales both along and across strike; to examine topographic characteristics that may be responsive to changes in climate erosion rate and erosion process; and to determine the correlation between precipitation events and land slide hazards in remote mountains. Our research ""tools"" include: SRTM topography for the Himalaya and adjacent areas (with gaps filled) existing and forth coming TRMM precipitation data at high spatial resolution (5km) ASTER imagery (U- Th)/Hedating of detritalapatite and cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in detrital sediments within the Himalaya. Previous data indicate that a long-strike variations in erosion exist but are poorly quantified in the Himalaya. Helium dating of apatite and measurement of cosmogenic nuclide concentrations will enable us to estimate erosion at two very different time scales. These data will then be interpreted in the context of: the TRMM precipitation data and its variations along and across the Himalaya; topographic variations along the range; and model edindices of erosion that integrate rain fall topography and erosion models. Furthermore repeat ASTER imagery will be used to identify large land slides define spatial variations in land slide size and frequency and examine the correlations of these spatial variations with rain fall and topographic anomalies. This project's significance resides in three aspects. First we will develop some of the highest resolution data that has ever generated for large mountain belt with respect to relationships among erosion climate and topography. Second the integration and numerical exploration of these data will permit us to quantify the controls on erosion and the relationship of climate to climate on long and short timescales.

The potential for MPA's at the Channel Islands and throughout CA to achieve the goals of the MLPA can be assessed only through monitoring of reserves. The primary technique used for reserve monitoring at the Channel Islands is visual SCUBA survey. This survey technique while essential and informative is inadequate for a number of important fishery species that are nocturnal cryptic and/or live at great depth (spiny lobster and some fishes). The use of traps is a more efficient sampling approach for these species especially when conducted collaboratively by biologists and commercial fishermen. An additional advantage of trap surveys is that they facilitate tag-recapture studies of growth stock size movement and fishery/MPA interactions. We have used traps successfully in preliminary collaborative monitoring studies in the Channel Islands. PISCO and NPS researchers using SCUBA surveys show great interest in partnering with us to improve overall monitoring of Channel Island and other MLPA reserves. This project will focus on conducting trap surveys to assess the performance of northern Channel Island MPAs for CA spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) CA sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) grass rockfish (Sebastes restrilleger) and other fishes targeted by California‚Äôs live-fish fishery. Our research will build off two successful collaborative trapping programs begun in 2001 (live fish Caselle) and 2005 (Kay and Lenihan lobster) with fishers from Santa Barbara Harbor and CDF&G biologists.,2007,2010
Chen Ji,6/1/08,5/31/09,"$20,462 ",US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,08CRGR0001,Collaborative Research with UCSB and USGS: Feasibility test for finite fault inversions based on irregular geometry,Recent developments in global broadband seismic instrumentation and in inverse methods have made it possible to routinely study the earthquake slip history based on teleseismic observations and proceed to predict the local damage [e.g. Ji et al. 2004]. However current fast finite fault solution was limited by its simple parameterization to the fault geometry i.e. a planar fault plane with constant fault strike and dip angles inferred from a point source CMT solution. As showed in our recent study of the 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake considering the down-dip variation of the fault dip angle and using a more appropriate velocity structure strongly reshapes the inverted slip distribution and ends up a 4 times difference in inverted peak slip. Attempts have been made to resolve this problem by predefining the fault geometry using relocated seismic catalog and moment tensors [Hayes and Wald 2008]. But how to incorporate these results into fast finite fault inversion is still not resolved. This pilot proposal aims to find feasible mesh algorithm for the fast finite fault inversions based on arbitrary fault geometry.,2008,2009

The faults responsible for two regional folds adjacent to Los Angeles are not well-characterized and their activity is controversial. These structures are the Palos Verdes anticlinorium, underlain by the San Pedro Escarpment fault, and the southwest limb of the San Joaquin Hills, underlain by the Oceanside thrust. The continental slope between Newport Beach and Oceanside is the sea floor expression of the latter fold limb. The Palos Verdes anticlinorium is a 70 km-long structure located immediately adjacent to Los Angeles, with much of it lying offshore. A SW-dipping backthrust had previously been proposed beneath the southwest limb, and recently a SW-dipping normal-separation fault has been proposed as the principle fault along the base of the fold limb. An alternate interpretation is possible: NE-dipping blind and partly blind (oblique) thrust faults, including the San Pedro Escarpment fault, underlie the anticlinorium, and align in 3D with the controversial Compton thrust beneath Los Angeles. The larger area of the proposed combined fault, as well as the opposite dip and/or slip sense of its shallow offshore part, would have critical implications for earthquake hazard. These include duration, location, and amplitude of strong ground motion above the deep sedimentary basin on which the Los Angeles metropolitan area is built. Thrust uplift of San Pedro Shelf and of the Shelf Projection in Santa Monica Bay could generate large local tsunamis.

Climate change directly affects the distribution and viability of sagebrush and exacerbates the influence of many existing stressors. The probability of listings of sagebrush-obligate or sagebrush-associated species including birds under federal and state endangered species acts is increasing as a result. The status of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a high priority. The historical range of Greater Sage-Grouse overlapped with 12 western states and with three Canadian provinces. Greater Sage-Grouse currently occupy ~50% of their historical range and the abundances of many populations are declining by as much as 2% per year. Population trends of many other sagebrush-associated species are similar. For example abundances of populations of Brewer‚Äôs Sparrow (Spizella brewerii) have been declining by 3% per year. Whether Greater Sage- Grouse warrant listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has been debated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and district courts for more than five years. In the meantime efforts to conserve the species and its habitat are well underway. In June 2008 the Western Governors‚Äô Association issued Policy Resolution 08‚Äì12 Sagegrouse and Sagebrush Conservation which recognized ‚Äúa continuing need to evaluate the species‚Äô status and develop overall management criteria at the range-wide level so conservation needs and successes can be assessed.‚Äù On 29 October 2008 the Governor of Nevada announced an Executive Order declaring that the state‚Äôs policy is to preserve and protect habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse whenever possible. Prescribed fire and other fuels management treatments have been suggested as mechanisms to minimize potential expansion of non-native plants and increase habitat quality and quantity for Greater Sage-Grouse. These treatments also may reduce the probability of severe wildfires which can have undesirable effects on social economic cultural and ecological values. However achieving long-term goals related to fire and fuels may conflict with short-term goals related to survival and viability of threatened and endangered species. Explicit evaluation of spatial and temporal tradeoffs in management of woodlands to reduce wildfire risk maintain sagebrush systems and conserve rare or sensitive species can identify strategies that are either consistent or incompatible with achieving simultaneously these and other objectives.,2010,2013

Brown, Jr. NEES sites, along with recently developed powerful inversion methods, and the increasing availability of earthquake records, will make it possible for the first time to reconstruct the three-dimensional material profile of local sites and complex basins alike. The problem of site and basin characterization is of great importance to hazard mitigation because knowledge of the in-situ material properties of soil deposits and deeper geological structure is essential for assessing earthquake ground motion; and forecasting this ground motion is an essential first step in designing earthquake resistant facilities and retrofitting existing structures. Thus, a proper knowledge of the geology and soil conditions at local and regional scales is a necessary precursor of the design process. The main objective of the proposed research is to develop the capability for estimating the three- dimensional geological structure and mechanical properties of individual sites and complete basins, and to apply this capability to the nees@UCSB site at the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) and the entire Garner Valley. This high-resolution estimation will be based on integrating (a) in-situ dynamic excitation using NEES equipment primarily at the University of Texas at Austin (nees@UTexas) developed for advancing the state-of-the-art in in-situ dynamic material property characterization and field testing of soil deposits, (b) earthquake records from new strong-motion and broadband sensor networks, and (c) new inversion methods based on partial differential equations (PDE)-constrained optimization being developed under separate NSF grants. Our reasons for choosing these particular NEES sites are: (1) The equipment at the nees@UTexas site will allow us to apply loads at a wide range of frequencies and loading levels, which will enable us to examine the variability of the soil properties with these parameters. In addition to estimating shear-wave velocity and primary-wave velocity, we propose to include damping in our inversion model as a key soil property to be estimated simultaneously with the two velocities. Despite the critical influence that material attenuation in soils has on dynamic phenomena such as site amplification, damping remains, perhaps, the most poorly known 198 dynamic mechanical soil property. (2) The GVDA is a test site located in a narrow valley in a highly seismic region in southern California, which is ideally suited for monitoring ground motion. The site consists of a set of seven downhole strong-motion instruments. The hundreds of small earthquakes that have been recorded at the site and at other, free surface, locations throughout this valley in the last 15 years make it an invaluable source of data for our regional deep structure inversions. To increase the fidelity of the inverted models, we propose to augment this dataset with data from instruments of the USArray component of EarthScope that we plan to deploy over periods of time that will overlap the periods of active testing. In-situ tests will provide data for characterizing the upper layers at the GVDA site and throughout the valley. Observations from these tests, both downhole and on the free surface, will be used as part of the data set for the inversion of our three-dimensional, high-resolution models, along with earthquake observations.",2006,2012

Developing a clear understanding of climate & human-induced changes in environmental N cycling in tightly coupled atmospheric, terrestrial, & aquatic systems & understanding how these changes feed back into the climate system are critical to addressing this challenge. In the Pacific Northwest (PNW), the interactions among N, carbon (C), climate & human activities are complex. The region has extensive & diverse agricultural lands surrounded by pristine natural ecosystems, interspersed with heavily populated urban areas. The topography of the area is diverse, & the terrain is drained by extensive river systems, including the vast Columbia River Basin (CRB). Storm patterns are closely tied to the jet stream position & sensitive to long-term circulation patterns including the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) & Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO). Given this complexity, a challenge is to understand & quantify the interactions & feedbacks between N & C cycling in coupled atmospheric, terrestrial, & aquatic systems as they are affected by the climate system at inter-annual to decadal time- scales over the PNW region. The overarching goal of this project is to improve understanding of the interactions among C, N, & H2O at the regional scale in the context of global change to inform decision makers’ strategies regarding natural & agricultural resource management. The approach will create a regional modeling framework by integrating and/or linking a network of state-of-the-art process-based models that are currently in existence & that are undergoing continuous development & evaluation, & to do so in collaboration with stakeholders. The Bio- EASM framework includes: WRF for meteorology, CMAQ for atmospheric chemistry & transport, VIC for hydrology, CropSyst for agricultural dynamics, RHESSys for natural ecosystem dynamics, NEWS for aquatic nutrient transport & CREM for economic interactions. Subcontract PI is the principle developer of RHESSys. The subcontract allows PI expertise to integrate RHESSys within the EASM framework & contribute to application of the integrated modeling framework to improving understanding of environmental change. With this framework, UCSB will be involved in integration process: simulations in a series of steps with increasing model integration & coupling to address questions related to 1) how climate variability affects regional biogeochemical cycling with specific focus on N & C, 2) how do regional N & C cycles feed back to climate in terms of greenhouse gas fluxes in the context of landuse change & inter- annual variability, & 3) how do land use & agricultural production decisions affect the interactions of N, C & climate & how do these interactions interplay with economic drivers. PI will supervise a post-doctoral scholar who will work on the RHESSys evaluation for a series of focus study sites, & RHESSys integration into Bio-EAsSM. Evaluation of RHESSys will include set-up, calibration & sensitivity analysis of RHESSys carbon, nitrogen & hydrologic estimates at the focus study sites with particular emphasis on evaluation the nitrogen cycling component. UCSB will undertake any necessary refinements to RHESSys based on retrospective, site-specific analysis. PI will work with other PIs to decide on appropriate data sets for retrospective, & N- deposition & climate change scenarios for stand-alone RHESSys modeling, and will work with other PIs to develop papers on these off-line RHESSys model applications.

However due to the current lack of regulation chemical content disclosure and consumer awareness most manufacturers have little incentive to replace chemicals-of-concern (COCs) with safer alternatives. Assembly Bill 1879 requires DTSC to develop the Safer Consumer Products Regulations that establish a process to identify products that pose high risk to humans and the environment. Once identified the regulations require manufacturers to evaluate safer alternatives to COCs in those products by following an AA protocol and considering the impacts of the COCs and alternative formulations from life cycle (LC) perspective. By integrating LC thinking into the AA manufacturers can avoid shifting environmental burdens and making environmentally unfavorable substitutions. California State regulations permit DTSC to compile a list of 1200 candidate COCs. The list of candidate chemicals can be found at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/SCP/ChemList.cfm. DTSC must identify consumer products containing COC‚Äôs and compile guidance for AA. The regulations apply to any COC ‚Äì containing product sold distributed supplied or manufactured for sale in California. In March of 2014 DTSC issued a list of 3 high-priority products of concern.

Accurate knowledge of the ocean surface current field is necessary for predicting the path of spilled oil. The MMS has thus been actively funding ocean circulation studies in the Santa Barbara Channel since at least the historical 1969 oil spill to understand how wind and pressure driven currents combine with transient mesoscale eddies and other motions to comprise the local circulation patterns. Although the number of oil/gas leases in the Santa Barbara channel is presently being reduced, an understanding of current patterns is still necessary for spill risk assessment, for monitoring natural seepage, and for determining how nutrients, larvae, and contaminants move to marine habitat around obsolete structures as part of the MMS Rigs-to- Reefs program (http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/rigs-to- reefs/information.html).

The ARGOS-CODE drifters used in the SBC-SMB study give position data with 1 km spatial accuracy every few hours and are not appropriate for resolving inner-shelf flow patterns. Thus, circulation patterns defined for the SBC hold only for basin-scale currents, and may not be indicative of flows over the inner-shelf. Dever et al. (1998) ultimately report that drifters over the inner-shelf “exhibited behavior quite different from drifters found in the open channel.” This leads to the questions: 1) What are the characteristic patterns of circulation over the inner-shelf? 2) How do the inner-shelf patterns relate to the basin-scale patterns reported by Winant et al. (2003)? 3) What are the dominant forcing mechanisms? This research seeks answers to these questions.",2004,2010

During the first year of this project we have identified and mapped the major seismic sources of the CFB established a relative chronology of deformation on individual faults and folds and are working to establish the tectonic framework and links to the regional geologic environment. As suggested by the previous years review panel and of critical importance to this research is establishing the Pleistocene to Holocene chronology in the fold belt. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the entire research project and if we are unable to adequately date deposits that are deformed we will be unable to estimate rates of tectonic processes which is critical to quantification of the earthquake hazard. In other words no dates no rates. Our initial project utilizes several radiocarbon dates as well as Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dates being completed by Dr. Lewis Owen at the University of Cincinnati who visited the site in March. Together we collected 12 OSL samples to place temporal limits on some of the late Pleistocene sediments. Additionally we are working in collaboration with several consulting companies who excavated three trenches across the Camarillo fold and fault. From these fault- trenches we collected several samples for dating from young steeply-tilted fluvial strata as well as two colluvial wedge deposits that we interpret to be tectonic in origin. Thus we were able to capitalize on these trenches that probably would have cost $100k and were located in exactly the place we would have attempted to investigate the fold. In the first year of our project we learned that the Saugus Fm. is critical to the long-term (105 yr) deformational history of the CFB. Most of the folds have deformed Saugus strata however the age of the Saugus Fm. is all but unknown. Dating the Saugus Fm. is a high priority and yet it lies beyond the range of most geochronometers (>200 ky). However during field work we discovered paleosols developed in and on the Saugus Fm. that are characterized by pedogenic carbonate. Similar soil carbonates as old as 600 ky have been successfully dated in the past using uranium-series dating. Given the importance of developing a reliable chronology for the Saugus Fm. we are collaborating with professors Richard Teh-Leung Ku and Shangde Luo at the University of Southern California who are experts in uranium-series dating of terrestrial deposits. This proposal seeks funds to support development of the mid-Pleistocene chronology of the Saugus Fm. Research Objectives: The objectives for the continuation of our project on the CFB are: Expand our OSL dating of the relatively younger deposits that overly the Saugus Fm. Obtain several uranium-series dates on soil carbonate horizons to determine the age of the Saugus Fm. Using the Mid-Pleistocene to Holocene chronology estimate the long-term rates magnitude and timing of active tectonics across the fold belt. Research Methods: Sample paleosols and deformed soils developed on the Saugus Fm. for uranium-series dating. Map the distribution and orientation of soils characterizing the depositional top of the Saugus Fm. Construct balanced cross-sections across the CFB tied to the Mid-Pleistocene to Holocene chronology to assess the magnitude and rates of tectonic deformation in space and time along the fold belt. Anticipated Results: The mid-Pleistocene to Holocene chronology of deformed strata and the age of the Saugus Fm in the CFB.

The common approach for atmospheric correction is to use top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiance in the near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared (SWIR) to select a ‘standard’ aerosol model, and to then use this model to calculate the TOA atmospheric radiance in the visible (VIS). This approach suffers from limitations that severely restrict the accuracy of water-leaving radiance retrievals especially in coastal regions covered by absorbing aerosols. We propose using radiance observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) and O2 A-band as well as polarized multiangle radiance measurements in the VIS-NIR-SWIR to improve the efficacy of atmospheric correction for remote sensing of coastal waters. We will mostly utilize currently sponsored flights of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) onboard an ER-2 (high-altitude) aircraft to obtain the requisite NUV and O2 A-band over the coast of California. We will provide the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) onboard the ER-2 at minimal cost to obtain the requisite multiangle VIS-NIR- SWIR polarized radiance. We will expand existing inversion algorithms to include these radiance data, and expand our ocean model to include independent variations for underwater-light scattering and absorption. Validation of atmospheric correction results will be performed by comparing the resulting water-leaving radiance with ship-based measurements from the NASA Plumes and Blooms (PnB) ocean color project. We will compare our ocean color retrievals with those retrieved from coincident satellite observations, and perform extensive sensitivity studies, to evaluate the benefits to atmospheric correction of adding NUV radiance, O2 radiance, and multiangle VIS-NIR-SWIR polarized radiance to the common suite of VIS-NIR-SWIR ocean color observations. The proposed research is the first to date to examine in detail and quantify the anticipated improvement in atmospheric correction when such measurements are included. The 169 need for NUV radiance measurements to achieve this objective has been recognized in the recent formulation of threshold requirements for the NASA Pelagic and Coastal Ecosystem (PACE) mission. The PACE mission also advocates the contemporaneous use of multispectral and multiangle polarized radiance and of O2 A-band radiances to improve atmospheric correction. The results of the proposed research will also benefit other planned NASA missions, such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) missions, which add UV (and O2) bands and also require improved atmospheric correction algorithms. Analyzing the AVIRIS, RSP and ship based measurements is a highly complex undertaking that requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists. Dr. Chowdhary has worked for over a decade on the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and ocean properties from RSP measurements. He developed a state-of-the-art radiative transfer program for polarized underwater light, and is a member of the Glory Science Team (GST) and the PACE Science Definition Team (PSDT). Dr. Alexandrov, Dr. van Diedenhoven, and Dr. Knobelspiesse have worked extensively on developing state-of-the-art inversion algorithms for RSP and APS data, and are also members of the GST. Mr. McCubbin has been part of the AVIRIS team at JPL for 15 years, and has extensive flight operation experience with AVIRIS and the ER-2. Dr. Cairns is the instrument scientist for the RSP and APS instruments, a member of the PSDT and the GST, and has overseen analyses of RSP data from all previous field campaigns. Dr. Siegel is a member of the PSDT, has overseen the PnB project for more than 15 years and is a developer of recent satellite ocean color analyses that use spectral inversion algorithms.",2013,2014

This seasonal inundation connects river channels to adjacent floodplains driving immense biological and ecological productivity. The ecosystem services derived from this floodplain system provide food and livelihoods for local people. However climate and land-cover changes are increasing the frequency and severity of extreme climate events such as droughts and intense rain resulting in greater variability and decreased predictability of the annual flood. This disruption may adversely affect fishery yields and floodplain vegetation productivity. Despite the importance of Amazon inundation dynamics for both ecosystem health and local livelihoods we know relatively little about the vulnerability of these systems to changing climate and extreme events. This project will increase our understanding of the mechanisms linking basin-wide hydrology river-floodplain connectivity and the productivity of floodplain ecosystems by 1) quantifying the relationship between flood extent and the productivity of fisheries and floodplain vegetation and 2) modeling the effects of deforestation and extreme climatic events on inundation dynamics under historic and alternative future scenarios.

Understanding the effects of these dynamics on air water exchanges of CO2 and CH4 is of critical importance if we are to estimate the net contribution of Amazon wetlands to greenhouse gas emissions. To quantify this influence it will be necessary to improve estimates of the fluxes and balance of carbon, incorporating the principal sources of spatial and temporal variability and developing numerical models to simulate and integrate their effects. To do so, we propose to combine hydrological and biogeochemical modeling with analysis of existing data. The overarching question of our proposed research is: How do the overall CO2 and CH4 cycles and carbon pools in the Amazon, including catchment and aquatic systems, respond to the changing climate, especially significant changes in the water cycle? To address this question, the UCSB aspect of the proposed research will enhance the modeling capabilities of Community Land Model by adding an aquatic ecosystem module that includes multi-scale carbon and methane biogeochemistry.",2013,2014

How these changes will impact the state depend on multiple factors including climate change impacts within the state changes in timber prices due to climate change and impacts of land use change on private timber lands. This study will incorporate a multi- faceted biological and economic model to capture the most important drivers of this change. The methods used in this study will build on the approach taken by Mendelsohn (2003) with improvements through incorporating information from multiple biological models particularly a species-based model of biological effects of climate change. We will use estimates of land use change available within the biological model to improve on the previous assumption of no changes in land use. Both public and private timberlands will be encompassed in the study. The biological model will generate information on species composition at a site with volume being estimated from age class and net primary productivity. The economic model takes this information and develops estimates of economic change in a multi-stepped process. First timber harvests and net revenues are calculated under a baseline case of no climate change as a reference. In the baseline case we assume that forest productivity in each region of the state will remain constant. In calculating the impact of climate change on timber markets we look at species with the highest timber value and volume across private and public timberlands as reported by the State Board of Equalization and other sources. These include ponderosa pine hemlock and fir and miscellaneous conifer. Where multiple species are aggregated under a general name other sources will be used to estimate actual contribution of individual biological species. We then calculate average productivity of each species in each county by dividing harvests by acreage and use those yield functions to estimate a rotation age for each species using timber harvest and value statistics also provided by the State.,2008,2010

Current models of species responses to climate change are generally at scales of 5-100 km and use climate projections with single windows of 50-80 years which is a very coarse resolution relative to the generation times and processes of plants and animals. Therefore moving down in spatial scale and incorporating multiple time steps opens many productive research pathways for collaboration between climatologists and biologists. Refining spatial and temporal scale comes with a series of challenges. Computational time increases exponentially rather than linearly with dimensions of scale. Stochastic processes become much more important as well leading to multiple outcomes as the model uncertainty increases. This research program will apply the BioMove model and other tools to climate change assessment at biologically relevant scales. It will pioneer new methods of working at fine scale as well as test the established model BioMove in these applications. Products of this research will include an analysis that will identify optimal networks of sites important for the conservation of species through multiple time-steps as climate changes in California. The project will also improve fire modeling develop a better understanding of vegetation regeneration and fire interactions at fine scale develop methods at annual temporal scales and create solutions for temporal spatial and computation problems.,2009,2012

Within the Western US, spatial differences in subsurface drainage rates (groundwater recharge) can exacerbate summer streamflow losses associated with diminishing snowpacks due to climate change. So far in California, the PIER program has funded the use of a macro-scale hydrological model (Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model) to study how climate change may impact water resources. More detailed, process-based distributed hydrologic models may produce different hydrological responses to climate change, especially with their more detailed representation of groundwater recharge.

Attempts at creating a facies model for hyperpycnal flow deposits are based on either ancient examples where their presence can only be inferred from sedimentary characteristics or modern studies that sample the flows themselves but not necessarily their deposits. The study of Quaternary systems bridges the gap between modern processes, which provide predictive metrics of sedimentary characteristics, and ancient deposits representing petroleum reservoirs. The few existing Quaternary examples of deposits produced by hyperpycnal flows focus on the broad scale of deposition and rarely describe individual geomorphic features resulting from hyperpycnal flows. A recent marine bathymetric survey of the northern Santa Barbara Channel continental shelf by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) revealed the presence of shallow-water submarine fans immediately offshore of several small mountainous streams. Based on observations of modern discharges from these and similar systems in the northern Santa Barbara Channel, we hypothesis that these geomorphic features represent the deposits of hyperpycnal flows and dense bedload-dominated underflows emanating from steep mountain catchments. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize these features using high-resolution seismic profiles, sediment grab samples, underwater camera operations, and shallow cores. The characterization of these deposits will allow an evaluation of their potential for reservoir quality sands and provide one of the few modern examples of a subaqueous fan delta from a semi-arid setting.",2013,2015

Increasing demand for this limited resource requires improved management including simulation models that describe the timing and availability and quality of water in the region. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) is the most intensively monitored watershed in the region and has a 48-year data record. We are able to effectively and accurately simulate the distribution of precipitation snow deposition and melt soil moisture and streamflow within the RCEW. It is not clear how to extend these findings over wider regions within the semi-arid Great Basin in the western US. While the cost of duplicating the detailed measurement and monitoring programs in place within RCEW to other mountainous drainages within the Western US is prohibitive the National Science Foundation (NSF) WATer and Environmental Research Systems (WATERS) Network has requested that ARS join them in undertaking an effort determine which measurements and the critical measurement density required to extend the detailed information available within RCEW to other mountain drainages across the Western US. This project will: 1) Apply the modified Penn State Integrated Hydrology Modeling (PIHM) system over RCEW using all available data; 2) Selectively reduce input data to determine the minimum input forcing data required to achieve acceptable simulation accuracy; 3) Recommend augmentation of existing measurement facilities and models that would be required to achieve this level of simulation accuracy over other mountain drainages in the Western US.,2008,2011

The primary task of the UCSB group is to develop and apply 35S methodology to determine the portion of streamflow derived from the previous winter‚Äôs snowpack. 35S a radioactive isotope with a half-life 87.4 days is produced in the upper atmosphere and enters the hydrologic cycle as dissolved SO42- through precipitation. Because radioactive decay causes the activity of this isotope to decrease below detection limits after about four half-lives (approximately one year) its presence in water indicates that a fraction is derived from recent precipitation. Given the seasonality of precipitation in the Sierra this new method will allow us to quantify the fraction of stream flow derived from the most recent snowmelt. Stream water derived from snow that fell two or more winters before will not contain detectable 35S.,2009,2011

While climate change is a global phenomenon, climate change impacts will be region specific. In Southwest US, climate change is predicted to lead to increases in droughts, increases in heat waves and decreases in snowpack. These changes are expected to have profound consequences on water management practices in the Southwest. We propose to develop a method of assessing the vulnerability of water supply at the scale of a municipal watershed with the expectation that our results will be immediately useful to both the scientific community and water managers. Our approach will address several key scientific challenges that arise in assessing climate change impacts at local watershed scales. Specifically we will explicitly consider coupled eco-hydrologic responses to climate change, including the impact of drought on vegetation water use through plant physiologic responses and indirectly through fire and disease. We will also assess different approaches for downscaling climate model scenarios to local watershed scales and quantify the sensitivity of model predictions to downscaling approaches.

Douglas Burbank,9/15/09,9/14/11,"$23,500 ",National Geographic Society,"Private agency, foundation",8685-09,Controls on Deformation of the Kyrgyz Tien Shan,What controls patterns of active faulting in compressional orogens? Rapid Cenozoic convergence within the Tien Shan of Kyrgyzstan has produced clear evidence for episodic shifting of the loci of faulting from the bedrock-bounded margins of sedimentary basins to their interiors. This observation is consistent with predictions of analogue and numerical models in which active deformation is modulated by erosion or addition of topographic loads [Harris et al. 1995; Simpson 2004; Tucker and Slingerland 1996; Turpeinen et al. 2008]. Analogue models predict that removal of mass from hanging walls by erosion and addition of mass to footwalls by sedimentation serve to retard the formation of new faults within a basin [Hoth et al. 2006]. Numerical models similarly predict that erosion above a fault can promote fault activity by decreasing the normal stress across the fault [Hilley et al. 2005; Simpson 2006]. Other numerical studies indicate that without removal of sedimentary fill by river networks closed basins can persist with little internal deformation for long periods of time [Sobel 2003]. We propose to address some of the key controls on changes in patterns of deformation within actively deforming contractional ranges. We pose the following questions: Under what conditions do former intermontane basins become sites of active localized deformation? When deformation migrates from the basin margin to its interior are the new faults juvenile structures that rupture the underlying basement or are they low-angle structures such as decollements that are linked to the basin marginal faults? When a basin narrows as basin-bounding thrusts impinge across its margins do rates of shortening decrease and does the loci of deformation shift into other basins? We hypothesize that migration of deformation into former depocenters is modulated by erosional evacuation and unloading of basins and that as a basin is zippered closed by thrusts the loads of the marginal ranges decrease the magnitude of deformation within the basin itself.,2009,2011

A vegetation dynamics model BIOMOVE will be applied to a small set of indicator species to produce a database that supports the analysis of future vegetation conditions. BIOMOVE is a species-based model for assessing vegetation dynamics that are likely to result under future climate change scenarios. Using climate change data the model identifies the environmental conditions that could support an individual species under a future climate scenario and evaluates the likelihood of a species occupying the site given constraints from disturbance and competition. In particular the model simulates fire behavior as a constraint on dispersal. Each model run produces a GIS database that shows the future distribution of individual species. To support the 2010 Forest and Range Assessment Report being conducted by FRAP the project will be conducted to evaluate potential climate change impacts on forest vegetation. A small set of indicator species will be used to assess potential impacts from future climate change scenarios. The potential shifting and migration of these indicators species will be evaluated using the BIOMOVE model. The BIOMOVE model will be parameterized for two GCMs (global climate models) capturing the broadest range of climatic variability using the most recent IPCC climate forecast data for at least one future climate scenario.

As a result, models of the APIS since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) vary dramatically. One method of estimating the past thickness of ice sheets is the inversion of sea-level data using geophysical techniques. However, along the Antarctic Peninsula few sea-level curves exist and the few curves that do exist are in areas of known tectonic activity or subject to the limitations of a radiocarbon-derived chronology, such as a scarcity of material to date, the uncertainties associated with radiocarbon reservoir affects, and the imprecise relationship of datable material to past sea levels. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating is a method not subject to the same limitations as radiocarbon dating. As a result it is possible to date features that are not accessible with radiocarbon methods, in particular cobbles within raised beach ridges and boulder pavements. Preliminary OSL ages from beach ridges in the South Shetland Islands of the 188 Antarctic Peninsula show agreement with existing reservoir-corrected radiocarbon-derived sea- level curves. The purpose of this proposal is to acquire OSL dates from whole cobbles within raised beach ridges and boulder pavements from five areas in the Antarctic Peninsula. This research is transformative in the methods for obtaining ages from raised beach deposits for the creation of sea level curves for the region. Our central hypothesis is that systematic differences in sea-level histories can be seen from north to south and east to west across the Antarctic Peninsula. These systematic differences in the sea-level curves will provide important constraints on the thickness and retreat history of the APIS since the LGM. Accurate reconstructions of the ice sheet are particularly important for researchers attempting to disentangle the isostatic adjustment from satellite gravity measurements suggesting mass loss (melting) in the region and predicting the future fate of ice sheets in light of predictions of sea-level rise and global warming.",2010,2013

A large backstepping event has been identified within several Gulf Coast estuaries around 2.6 ka. The continued debate concerning the nature of sea-level change over the last 5 ka, coupled with the lack of century-scale records of climate change, leaves the cause of this event unclear. We propose to use two methods of sea-level and climate reconstructions not previously used in Gulf of Mexico studies to provide tighter constraints on the sea-level and climate history of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico over the last 5 ky. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the sea-level and climate history along the south Texas coast at a decade-to century-scale resolution over the last 5 ky. Our central hypothesis is that the large backstepping event at 2.6 ka and the formation of higher-than-present beach ridges around Baffin Bay, Texas is not a response to a mid-Holocene highstand along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico but instead occurred in conjunction with severe drought conditions during the middle to late Holocene. In order to test our central hypothesis we propose three specific objectives: (1) create a sea-level curve based on algal mats from the mud flats of upper Baffin Bay, (2) create a detailed record of drought based on isotopes and mineralogy of sediments within a playa lake near Baffin Bay, and (3) date and survey the existing beach ridges found along the shores of Baffin Bay using OSL. In addition to testing our central hypothesis, these new records will provide tighter constraints on the glacio-hydro-isostatic conditions affecting sea levels within the Gulf of Mexico, which will allow a better reconstruction of background rates of sea-level rise throughout the region including Louisiana. The new data will also provide a longer record of century-scale drought than currently exists for the south-central USA. The transformative concepts introduced by this research include the innovative nature of our sea-level reconstruction and testing the possibility that backstepping can be caused not only by elevated rates of sea-level rise but also by climate shifts (e.g., drought conditions).",2010,2012

However, the key to understanding tundra soil processes is nitrogen (N), as both plant growth and decomposition are severely N limited. However, current models of tundra ecosystems and their responses to climate change assume that while N limits plant growth, C limits decomposition. In addition, N availability is strongly seasonal with relatively high availability early in the growing season followed by a pronounced crash. There is a need to understand the controls on this seasonality to predict Arctic System responses to climate change, but there are multiple questions that need answers: 1) What causes the seasonal nutrient crash? 2) Does microbial activity switch seasonally between C and N limitation? 3) How will a lengthening of the growing season alter overall ecosystem C and N dynamics, as a result of differential extension of the periods before and after the nutrient crash? 4) What will be the larger impacts of these patterns on the Arctic system? Addressing these questions requires following plant and soil dynamics in a very tight time frame, coupling this understanding of the timing of C and N interactions to an enhanced mechanistic understanding of why the nutrient crash occurs, and then using transect sampling and ecosystem modeling to explore the large-scale implications of this seasonal crash. This proposed research will address our questions by: 1) Varying the length and timing of the growing season in the field by advancing snow melt and warming the ecosystem; 2) Establishing the fine scale seasonal time- courses of soil N availability, plant N content, leaf expansion, root growth and rhizodeposition, ecosystem respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity; 3) Conducting lab experiments to determine the extent to which microbial activity is limited by temperature, and C and N availability before and after the crash; 4) Determining how the timing of the nutrient crash and plant growth vary across a latitudinal transect; 5) Refining the Multiple Element Limitation model (MEL) that was developed for arctic ecosystems to better handle how plant and microbial systems respond to N limitation, and incorporating the specific drivers of the crash into MEL; 6) Testing the large-scale spatial and temporal effects of the seasonality of nutrient availability and how it may change in a warming Arctic with a lengthening growing season. This work will require intense mechanistic research focusing on transitions and transformations that occur over only a few weeks at most, but which have profound impacts on the tundra ecosystem. Researchers will scale this mechanistic work to the intermediate spatial scale by conducting transect measurements along a latitudinal transect to validate that patterns that occur locally are robust. They will scale to the whole Arctic system by integrating these mechanisms, and importantly, the N-effects on decomposition, into the MEL model that is designed to explore 163 multiple limiting resource effects on ecosystem function. As an integrated package, this research will explore how the changing seasonal pattern that drives the crash in N availability in tundra soils will alter overall tundra C-cycling and its role as a source or sink of C and through this its role in the global climate system.",2009,2013

UCSB will focus on soil microbial measurements on this project. That will involve several trips to Greenland each year to collect samples. They will return those samples to Santa Barbara and analyze them for nitrogen mineralization, microbial biomass, soil enzyme activities, and microbial community composition.

The spatial distribution of hydraulic mining sediment reworking and deposition in flood bypasses over the last century are relevant to the fate of contaminants, flood conveyance, and the land-use in the lower Sacramento Valley of California, which is undergoing a massive program of restoration and development, and to basic research on valley floor sediment budgets and floodplain sedimentation. This research employs a suite of new techniques and data to investigate the temporal and spatial links between Central Valley floodplain sedimentation and erosion of hydraulic mining sediment in the Sierra piedmont over the last century. Recent field evidence of episodic piedmont erosion and bypass deposition calls for a new investigation of the hydraulic mining sediment delivery problem in the lower Sacramento valley over the last century. The research will track the movement of fine sediments derived from hydraulic mining tailings in the lower Sacramento Valley. The research team will link spatial and temporal patterns and processes of deposition in Sutter and Yolo Bypasses (leveed floodplains of the Central Valley) with erosion of piedmont tailings of the lower Bear, Yuba, and Feather Rivers downstream of the last major dam on each. It will track historical erosion of hydraulic mining sediments in the piedmont through a combination of 190 photogrammetry, channel change analysis, and field surveys. The team will document history and provenance of mining sediment deposits in the Central Valley by granulometry, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, magnetism, and geochronology. In addition, records from a network of streamflow gauging stations will be perused for corroborative analysis of temporal correlation between piedmont erosion and Central Valley sedimentation. The project will produce quantitative, field-based estimates of volumetric sediment storage and erosion along piedmont channels and the timing of its evacuation. It will document geochemical, grain size, and magnetic properties of mining and non-mining sediment and develop appropriate mixing models for discerning the relative influence of each source downstream through the fluvial system. It will identify the spatial extent and volume of discrete sediment deposits in the bypass system, and document sedimentation rates and histories along various transects spanning Sutter and Yolo Bypasses. The research will develop quantitative links between piedmont erosion and bypass deposition that are based on historical hydrology and refined conceptual models of bypass sedimentation processes. It will provide the basis for predictive modeling of the impact of future floods on sediment movement through the Central Valley. The project will provide a quantitative basis for future management decisions and direction in the Sacramento Valley and a set of methodologies that can be applied to other large, managed river basins. Data and interpretations from this study will be of great practical use to river and environmental management in the lower Sacramento Valley and the Delta, where our results are of utmost importance to flood conveyance, maintenance of islands, and potential toxicity of sediment. This research will create educational opportunities for a new generation of geomorphologists, including those from historically underrepresented groups. The output from this research will be made available as a project website via the World Wide Web and provide direct K-12 scientific outreach through the NASA space consortium, an educator resource center.",2005,2010

Water resources in the region are already limited and are expected to become more so in coming decades. Higher air temperatures associated with climatic change will likely lead to reduced snow accumulation and melt, reducing summer streamflows. Understanding how large watersheds that are of mixed geologic composition with a range of snow accumulation and melt characteristics may respond to climatic change is an important step in analyzing regional responses to climatic change. Predicting spatial patterns of streamflow sensitivity associated with snowpack change is complicated by the influence of geology on the rate at which recharge (snowmelt or rain) becomes streamflow. Within the Oregon Cascades, distinct geologic differences between the younger High Cascade province and the older Western Cascade province are dominant controls on drainage rates and ultimately streamflow. The methods used in this study will include process-based hydrologic modeling (RHESSys) to predict distributed streamflow sensitivity to climatic change within the McKenzie River basin, a major Willamette River tributary. Fieldwork will monitor streamflow and produce a framework to distribute model parameters. Streamflow predictions will be integrated with reservoir models to assess the sensitivity to potential climatic change for three large reservoirs in the McKenzie watershed. The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the interaction among the controls of snowpack and geology on streamflow at multiple scales and its response to climatic change in the Oregon Cascades. This study is designed to advance our understanding and ability to model the complex interactions among climate, geology and streamflow in heteorogenous snow dominated mountain landscapes. This study explicitly addresses spatial heteorogenity and the associated challenges in applying hydrologic models. In particular, this study develops and assesses a geologic-based strategy for model parameterization. This approach will contribute to the ongoing hydrologic research initiative Predictions in Ungaged Basins (PUB) that is of considerable interest to the larger hydrologic community. This study will perform multi-criteria, and multi-scale evaluation of a hydrologic model, RHESSys, using both comparisons with multiple stream gauges and remote sensing of spatial patterns of snow cover. Study results will also integrate modeling of natural controls on climate-streamflow interactions with reservoir management models, which place streamflow results in a practical context. This research complements ongoing larger research initiatives designed to characterize the spatial structure of climatic change impacts on water resources within the western US mountains. This research will complement the PI’s previous work in this study area that has included fieldwork, empirical analyses, and hydrologic modeling.",2007,2009

The proposed research aims to (1) use an existing household survey and vegetation measurement database to examine how socioeconomic and biophysical factors influence household decisions and thus the fluxes of C N and P through households along a gradient of housing density; (2) determine the effect of consumption and pollution production by single family homes on fluxes of C N and P at the scale of the urban-exurban study region; and (3) examine how behavioral influences can be altered through social networks to change consumption choices and therefore elemental fluxes. Thus the study will establish a feedback loop between household choices elemental fluxes and back to household choices. At U.C. Santa Barbara PI McFadden will be responsible for the development and implementation of satellite data-driven models to scale vegetation carbon fluxes from a set of 400 field-measured households to the urban study region. PI King will be responsible for the analyses of relationships between household-level choices and biogeochemical fluxes of C N and P. All PIs on the project will contribute to advising the post- docs and graduate students on the research team synthesizing the findings from the different components of the project and publication of the results.

The project will apply these coupled LCA-GIS tools to model inventory flows and assess impacts on biodiversity of land use dynamics associated with biofuel crop production. Whereas land use and biodiversity are acknowledged as important elements in evaluating the environmental sustainability of product systems there are as yet no standard methods for accounting for them. Effects of land use on biodiversity depend on scale and spatial pattern of land use and land cover. In contrast LCA is traditionally linear and aspatial using average values for input and output flows. For types of impacts with small land requirements this averaging approach may be sufficient. For products with large land requirements such as agriculture and biofuels however the location and arrangement of production activities cannot be ignored. Combining LCA with GIS creates the potential to develop indicators that are meaningful for biodiversity and that can account for the spatially-dependent and non-linear consequences of land use change. This project will develop the tools to make this coupling of software systems feasible and practical for all LCA studies of product systems that have large land use requirements. GIS tools will be developed to generate inventory flows from land use in Life Cycle Inventory. Flow data will be integrated with ecological databases to create and compare various biodiversity characterization models and impact indicators. In addition to methodology and tool development it will also conduct a multidisciplinary graduate seminar in environmental sustainability and impact assessment with LCA and GIS to train a cadre of industrial ecology graduate students in this cutting-edge integration of technologies. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is twofold: overcoming the barriers to incorporating spatial differentiation in LCA methodology and solving the omission of biodiversity concerns in LCA. Biofuel production has been chosen as a prototype product system for several reasons. Environmental economic and political concerns about fossil fuels have dramatically increased the demand for biofuel alternatives. Although the potential of biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and some other environmental impacts has been studied extensively habitat and biodiversity consequences of largescale biofuel production systems have not been rigorously analyzed. Such impacts could be substantial and could be positive or negative depending on location-specific changes in land use and land management practices. However the developed approach will be sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide range of production processes and product systems that require spatially- explicit analysis. The broader impacts of the project therefore are that it will enable the coupling of GIS and LCA more generally and that it will enhance LCA to more fully quantify environmental sustainability and the tradeoffs between biodiversity and other concerns.,2009,2013

Subsurface core samples outcrop samples well logs reservoir properties pore pressures thermal gradients fluid compositions and structural-seismic sections are being studied to characterize the geohydrologic/diagenetic history and degree of compartmentalization for these known fault networks in a transpressional tectonic setting. We are also investigating the isotopic and trace elements signatures in calcium carbonate minerals including vaterite that characterizes rapid CO2 degassing as observed in scales from production well tubing in several petroleum and geothermal reservoirs. These data provide the constraints for our geohydrologic models that are being developed to predict fluid pressures multiphase fluid saturations rates and patterns of deformation and fluid flow subsurface temperature geothermal heat flow and fluid geochemistry associated with large fault systems. In past DOE-sponsored research we mathematically modeled reactions associated with the transport of petroleum SBB-sourced methane and meteoric groundwater mixing in faulted submarine reservoirs which are partially uplifted along coastal Santa Barbara. This fluid mixing simulation resulted in carbonate mineralization along the Carneros-Refugio fault as observed in outcrops. We have also recently developed basin-scale models that incorporate coupled processes of poroelastic deformation and fluid flow as well as field-scale models of multiphase flow for the NIFZ and Long Beach fields. Applications of the discrete element deformation model RICEBAL (as developed by J.K. Morgan Rice University) are underway and these will allow us to predict the opening and closing of fault conduits as the sedimentary basins undergo extension and contraction/inversion within the California plate boundary regions. We are also currently developing a new coupled flow-heat-poroelastic deformation model TUFTS2D-FE and a multiphase flow model TUFTS2D-FV and reactive flow applications for the NIFZ in the Los Angeles basin. There are plans for new industry-funded drilling of this fault zone in 2010 and if successful we will have access to remarkable core samples and borehole geology. This renewal proposal requests support for additional 3 years of work and details the field and modeling studies scheduled for these fascinating faults reservoirs and sedimentary basins. Our past collaborative research has been very productive and this new work will make new and important geologic contributions to understanding the leakage behavior of active faults in sedimentary basins.

Patricia Holden Joshua Schimel,3/1/05,2/28/10,"$400,000 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,DEB-0444712,Resource and Stress Interactions in Regulating Microbial Communities in a California Grassland Soil,Most soil microbiology studies examine only the top 10-20 cm of soil and do not evaluate communities and their functioning through the whole profile. A whole soil perspective is important: 1) while surface soils are more active per gram the massive deeper horizons contribute significantly to overall soil activity and 2) there are strong gradients of resource availability and stress through the soil profile. Understanding how interactive effects of resource and stress on soil microbes is key to understanding all microbial life in soil. Our research to date has addressed microbial diversity and function through the profile by evaluating whether the hypothesis from macroecology that diversity should be greatest at intermediate levels of resource availability and/or disturbance‚Äù applies in soil microbial ecology. This project will evaluate how resource availability and stress regulate microbial communities populations and functional groups through the profile. We will experimentally manipulate resource and stress regimes and evaluate microbial responses. Specific populations to study will be either characteristic of particular environments in the soil (i.e surface or deep) or particularly sensitive to environmental variation. Examples we have identified so far include Variovorax (a ‚Äúvadose zone specialist‚Äù) several pseudomonads an unusually high GC gram positive and Streptomyces lividans. The project will use terminally labeled restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLPs) to evaluate community-level diversity and composition. A combination of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) and probing using group-level primers and probes will be used to quantitatively analyze microbial communities at a range of taxonomic levels. Specific probes based on sequences of keystone clones that are found to be most responsive to imposed stress and resource conditions will be used to analyze individual populations and how they respond to the interactions of stress and varying resource availability.

Twenty-three years of research at the Emerald Lake watershed (Sequoia National Park) has shown that runoff patterns and the timing of snowmelt alter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry with concomitant changes in lake trophic conditions. Recent evidence indicates that Sierran lakes are undergoing eutrophication while shifting from P to N limitation; altered rates of atmospheric deposition of N and P and changes in P biogeochemistry of soils and lake sediments are likely causes. Observing and understanding the causes and consequences of these multi-year trends and variations in ecological conditions, requires appropriately designed long-term measurements complemented by experiments and modeling. The project investigators propose to continue long-term study of the Emerald Lake watershed and nearby catchments in order to test conceptual hypotheses regarding drivers of environmental change in high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. The primary foci of the proposed study are: i) continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing inputs of N and P and ii) continued study of the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. To further examine the effects of ongoing eutrophication, the proposed study also seeks to answer the following questions: a) At what rate is phosphorus being atmospherically deposited in the Sierra Nevada from anthropogenic and natural sources like fire? b) How do modern input rates of P to Emerald Lake and similar sites differ from those over the last two hundred years? c) How is P in the soils mobilized and transformed and how are these processes modified by variation in climate and hydrology? d) How much P is released from lacustrine sediments and how do the rates of release change as a function of variations in stratification, pH, dissolved oxygen and dissolved metals? These questions will be answered through the continuation of ongoing watershed measurements; additional study of P pools, transformation and fluxes in soils and sediments; enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition; and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. Climate conditions have a strong influence on potential P source areas, on the incidence of fires, on transport and deposition, and on ecological impacts. Hence, as a consequence of the considerable interannual variability in California’s Mediterranean climate, it is essential to conduct these studies for at least five to ten years.",2007,2013

Aquatic ecosystems integrate environmental conditions and can provide indications of how montane regions are responding to warming climate, changing snow regime and altered atmospheric deposition. Recent evidence indicates that aquatic ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada, while remote from development, are undergoing eutrophication from increased loading of nutrients. Consequently, our focus has been to asses the responses of productivity to changing inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus and to evaluate the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. We use a multi-faceted approach to achieve our goals. We combine long term high resolution measurements of Emerald Lake and neighboring lakes with periodic regional sampling throughout the Sierra Nevada. We have used this approach successfully with regard to acidic deposition, nitrogen balance, nutrient limitation and bacterial community composition (Melack and Stoddard 1991, Sickman et al. 2001, Sickman et al. 2002, Sickman et al. 2003, Nelson et al. in press). 139 As part of combined LTREB research and the dissertation studies of Steve Sadro, we have been measuring lake metabolism in Emerald Lake. Specifically, we have been evaluating spatial and temporal variability in lake metabolism and how overall metabolic balance is affected by different environmental drivers. This research integrates our understanding of nutrient loading and catchment processes as they interact with physical conditions in the lake to affect nutrient cycling and overall productivity. For the ice-free season of 2009, we propose to continue measurements at Emerald Lake to characterize physical and biogeochemical seasonal patterns. Water samples will regularly be collected from multiple depths to characterize nutrient and dissolved organic matter dynamics. In addition, we will deploy thermistor chains to characterize mixing dynamics. Similarly, optical oxygen sensors will be deployed and combined with periodic diel oxygen profiles to characterize lake metabolism and calculate productivity. We will also periodically use benthic incubation chambers to isolate benthic metabolic rates and to quantify rates of phosphorus exchange with the sediments. From mid-August to mid-September, during the period when Sierran lakes are most stratified, we will conduct a regional survey of lakes. We know from previous surveys that nutrient and dissolved organic matter concentrations, two important drivers of metabolic rates, vary in relation to lake position within a catchment. Lakes located high in a catchment, where there are few or no upstream lakes and where there is little vegetation, tend to have higher concentrations of inorganic nutrients and lower concentrations of dissolved organic matter than lakes lower in a catchment. While lake position in the landscape may influence some environmental drivers of metabolism, it remains unclear if natural gradients of these drivers will result in differences in metabolic balance between lakes. Our multi-lake survey will enable us to explore these relationships and place the temporal patterns found at Emerald Lake in a regional context.",2007,2011

Plant litter decomposition is the main control on soil fertility and carbon (C) sequestration. There is growing interest in understanding the conditions under which soils gain or lose C, in part, because soils contain more C than the atmosphere and could play either a moderating or exacerbating role in global warming. An integrated field, laboratory, and modeling study of the biochemical mechanisms driving interactions between soil C sequestration, plant litter chemistry, and microbial community composition and activity during decomposition is 164 needed to define these relationships. Moorhead and Sinsabaugh (2006) developed a new model that incorporates microbial dynamics into the decomposition process, the Guild Decomposition Model (GDM), which has generated a series of specific hypotheses about the mechanisms controlling the interactions between plant litter chemistry, C stabilization and microbial community composition and activity during decomposition. The proposed research will evaluate these hypotheses experimentally by monitoring changes in plant litter chemistry and microbial community composition and function during decomposition, with and without added N to mimic N deposition. Stable C isotope (13C) labeling will further determine the community composition of active microorganisms capable of metabolizing specific chemical components of plant litter. This research will provide mechanistic insight into the impacts on plant litter decomposition and soil C sequestration from N deposition, elevated CO2, plant community composition shifts, and climate change. The PI and a graduate student will travel to Ohio regularly to coordinate with the University of Toledo and cooperating groups on the field work, setting up and running incubations on the litter samples in Dr. Mike Weintraub’s lab. We will then return litter samples to UCSB and analyze them for 13C-labeled phospholipid fatty acids.

The gas transfer coefficient used in the calculation of fluxes depends upon turbulence at the air- water interface but in most biogeochemical studies either a fixed conservative value is used or one based on wind speed alone. Other processes which cause turbulence are neglected. We estimate that regional carbon budgets are in error by at least a factor of two and likely higher in warm water lakes due to incorrect parameterization of the gas transfer coefficient. The error is unknown in cold water lakes. The surface renewal model takes into account the various processes which induce turbulence in near-surface waters yet has never been validated for lakes. We propose to combine direct air-water flux measurements of carbon dioxide using eddy covariance techniques with in situ measurements of the water-side CO2 concentration profile turbulence and energy fluxes to evaluate and improve upon the surface renewal model of the gas transfer coefficient. We further propose studies using SF6 in lakes too small for EC studies with measurements taken on time scales of events which drive gas flux. We propose studies in an arctic temperate zone and tropical lake to capture the latitudinal variations in physical forcing which affect turbulence near the air-water interface. Our overarching goal is a formulation of the gas transfer coefficient which can be readily applied in ecosystem studies of lakes at any latitude.,2009,2015

This in turn creates variation in demo- graphic traits ‚Äî the propensity to survive more or less or to have more or fewer offspring (contrast with the actual life history an organism experiences ‚Äî its demographic fate; see Kendall & Fox 2003) as well as individual growth and dispersal rates. While ecologists do use models (like linear matrix models) that classify individuals by age stage or size and sex most assume that in doing so they have captured sufficient variation so that further variation is simply noise of small amplitude. This is not necessarily the case. This variation in traits occurs even when within categories such as age stage size or sex. We use the term ‚Äúdemographic heterogeneity‚Äù to refer collectively to the variation in birth death growth and dispersal rates among individuals in an age stage or size class.

For example heterogeneity in survival has been found in crocodiles (Isberg et al. 2006) baboons (Bronikowski et al. 2002) birds (Wintrebert et al. 2005 Fox et al. 2006) wild plants (Beckage and Clark 2003 Landis et al. 2005) domestic ani- mals(Ducrocq et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004) and humans(Yashin et al. 1999 Garibotti et al. 2006) including British aristocrats(Doblhammer and Oeppen 2003). Demographic heterogeneity has been shown to have a variety of effects on population dynamics. Heterogeneity in survival and reproduction can change the population variabliltydue to demographic sto- chasticity often reducing it relative to a homogeneous population with the same average rates. Heterogeneity in survival if it persists throughout the life cycle creates cohort selection which in turn increases the asymptotic population growth rate and equilibrium population densities. Finally heterogeneity in dispersal ability can increase the rate at which an invading population spreads.,2011,2015
Joshua Schimel Patricia Holden,5/1/12,4/30/15,"$607,635 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,DEB-1145875,Collaborative Research: Controls over C Sequestration: Physiology vs. Physics,"In this project, we will focus on an annual grassland to evaluate the mechanisms that regulate the fate of C. Grasslands in California cover over 10 million hectares (Jackson, 1985), are dominated by annual grasses, and are important ecosystems in the State. However, we have found comparable microbial dynamics in California grassland and Bishop pine forest, so we have confidence that the mechanisms we evaluate occur in other ecosystem types as well. The research will take place at the UCSB Sedgwick Reserve, which is located 50 km from the coast in the Santa Ynez Valley (43o42 ́30 ́ ́N, 120o2 ́30 ́ ́W). The climate is Mediterranean and characteristic of interior California, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Average rainfall is 380 mm/yr, but varies widely; El Niño years are notably rainy. The soils are pachic argixerolls in valley bottoms and typic argixerolls on slopes. The vegetation is dominated by Mediterranean annual grasses including Bromus diandrus, B. hordaceous, and Avena fatua. Our main site will be in the Figueroa watershed previously studied by Schimel and Holden. Analyzing the mechanisms involved requires controlled microcosm experiments that will be described below, but to explore how these mechanisms regulate how varying plant C inputs and moisture influence soil C storage, we propose a field experiment in which we modify: 1) plant C- inputs during the growing season (by thinning), and 2) the length of the dry season (by watering & rainout shelters). We will establish 3 blocks of 16 plots each (1 m x 1m) and establish a 165 factorial design in which we create gradients of plant inputs and the length of the summer drought. We will use modeling to integrate between the micro- and macro-scales. To modify plant inputs we will thin plots by hand to remove either 1/3, 2/3 or all the biomass (plus a control). Plots will be established initially after plants germinate in the fall of 2012 and new sprouts will be removed weekly or as necessary to maintain these approximate proportions. Soil moisture is likely to vary as transpiration losses will be lower in the thinned plots, but surface evaporation may partially compensate. Importantly, annual grasses senescence and die shortly after seed-set, not when the soils dry out. Thus, at the beginning of the summer, there will be a suite of plots with different amounts of dead roots to serve as substrate within the soils, with relatively similar moisture conditions (depending on the timing of spring rainfall). Dry-down after senescence will be purely by evaporation. Moisture manipulations will include control, lengthened summer drought, shortened drought, and no drought. To extend the drought, we will build rainout shelters to prevent rewetting during the winter following the thinning treatments. To shorten the drought, we will use weekly drip irrigation. The goal is not to keep soils constantly wet, but to mimic episodic precipitation and prevent soils from drying fully. The short-drought treatment will be irrigated into July, then allowed to dry normally, roughly halving the length of the typical drought. The no-drought treatment will be watered into October. We will regularly weed the watered-plots during the summer to remove new sprouts. Soil moisture will be monitored continuously (using soil moisture probes and dataloggers) in the experimental plots. Soil samples will be collected from all treatments to analyze C dynamics at four points through the year: 1) At peak live plant biomass late in the growing season (April/May), 2) early summer (just before the short-drought watering ends; late June), 3) midsummer (August), and 4) the end of the dry season (October or early January for the extended drought treatment). We will collect samples from the top 10 cm and analyze the essential C pools, including roots, light and heavy fraction OM, microbial biomass, etc. As these measures will be coupled to the work specifically testing the research hypotheses, we describe the details of those analyses in those sections. The field sampling will assess how environmental factors (C-supply and moisture) regulate C-pools and microbial activities, and the begin identifying the mechanisms connecting them. We will couple these to laboratory incubation studies to tease apart the specific mechanisms.",2012,2015

Experiments, both in the field and laboratory, have added mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes of Sierran lakes and watersheds. Comparative studies of biological and hydrochemical aspects of lakes, conducted from 1982 to the present, provide a regional context for examination of Sierra-wide conditions and responses to global change. Recent paleo-investigations at Emerald Lake and companion lakes have provided a multi-century context for the 31-year dataset from Emerald Lake. In our LTREB renewal, we propose to complete our decadal research plan to test the hypothesis that altered climate, changing snow regime and changes in atmospheric composition are driving biogeochemical and ecological changes in high elevation ecosystems. We propose to continue long-term study of the Emerald Lake watershed, Tokopah Valley and nearby catchments in order to test conceptual hypotheses regarding drivers of environmental change in high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. The primary foci 140 of the proposed study are: i) continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing atmospheric deposition and ii) continued study of the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. These questions will be answered through the continuation of on-going watershed measurements; additional study of lake metabolism; enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition; and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. Climate conditions have a strong influence on potential N&P source areas, on the incidence of fires, on transport and deposition, and lake ecology. Hence, as a consequence of the considerable interannual variability in California’s Mediterranean climate, it is essential to conduct these studies for at least ten years.",2012,2017

The proposed research will develop new understanding of the interplay between hydrology, sediment transport/storage, and biogeochemistry. The project is designed so that this new knowledge can be generalized and readily transferred to a wide range of fluvial systems beset by sediment-adsorbed contaminants. The study will focus on the longitudinal (downstream) transport and biogeochemical processing of sediment-adsorbed Hg derived from hydraulic gold mining in the Sierra Nevada and mercury mining in the Coast Ranges within and through the Yuba-Feather-Sacramento River system of Northern California, USA. It will document the primary sources (Coast Range v. Sierra Nevada) of Hg contamination to lowland ecosystems in the Sacramento Valley and Bay-Delta and the relative contribution and risks of each. It will challenge conventional wisdom by assessing how Hg bioavailability changes along sediment 191 transport pathways, irrespective of total Hg concentrations, and by identifying/quantifying the controlling processes at the intersection of sedimentation/inundation and biogeochemical modifications of Hg speciation. The proposed work will: 1) mathematically model flood inundation in river corridors to identify areas of high potential of oxidation/reduction; 2) identify preferential zones of sedimentation through numerical modeling of eventbased washload transport and interpret relative sediment deposit age via a detailed and spatially extensive library of sedimentary histories from prior work; 3) identify distinct contamination sources to lowlands by conducting Hg stable isotopic analysis of sediment; and 4) investigate Hg speciation and reactivity in conjunction with changes in Hg species isotopic signatures, associated with redox conditions, sediment source, and ambient chemistry.",2013,2015

The structure of the ophiolite makes it clear that the crust formed in an extensional environment similar to modern fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, making it an invaluable resource for studying MOR processes. However, many researchers have also highlighted important differences between the Oman- U.A.E. ophiolite and modern ridges, including geochemical differences between MOR basalts and extrusive lavas in the ophiolite and the presence of multiple generations of plutonism and volcanism within the mantle and crust. To determine how observations from the ophiolite can be applied to modern spreading centers, it is necessary to understand the tectonic setting during formation and emplacement of the ophiolite. The Principal Investigator recently completed an extensive U-Pb zircon geochronology and Nd isotope study of the ophiolite. The results from this study, together with previous work by other researchers, suggest that the age and composition of magmatism that post-dates formation of the ophiolite crust can provide important new insight into the tectonic history of the ophiolite. The proposed research would target three series of rocks: silicic sills and dikes in the mantle with Nd isotopic ratios that are distinct from the ophiolite crust; intrusive and extrusive rocks in the crust that post date the main phase of crustal growth; and leucocratic melts and amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic rocks from the metamorphic sole. The distinct isotopic and geochemical compositions of the first two series are likely related to development of a thrust fault or subduction zone below the ophiolite. Initial U-Pb zircons dates from these rocks are <0.1–0.25 Ma younger than the ophiolite crust. Further high precision geochronology and geochemical analyses, including Nd and Hf isotopic analyses, will map out the spatial and temporal development of subduction or thrusting along the length of the ophiolite. High-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology and geochemistry of the metamorphic sole will provide complementary information on conditions in the under thrust slab. This project will provide fundamental new insight into the tectonic development of the Oman-U.A.E. ophiolite and place direct temporal constraints on models of ophiolite genesis.",2013,2015

Ring-like filaments were observed at all grain boundaries in a highly sublimated sputter-coated sample two days after collection through filaments were much harder to find in uncoated samples. Filaments appeared in uncoated specimens from the same snow sample five months later through x-ray microanalysis failed to detect soluble impurities in the filaments grain boundary grooves or on ice grain surfaces above background noise levels. After eight months in storage and under forced sublimation in high vacuum the same sample produced not only grain boundary filaments but complex web-like structures nodules and films that in extreme cases formed castings of completely sublimated snow grains. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry reveals that the filaments and webs are composed of the same set of light elements typical of the solible impurities in Sierra snow. The spectra also reveal significant spatial variability in element ratios. Impurities probably concentrate in a quasi-liquid layer at the air/ice interface and in the disordered grain boundary region where crystal lattices are disoriented. If concentrated at grain boundaries these light elements could act as dopants reducing grain boundary energy reducing melting temperatures and promoting the sintering process.,2006,2010
Brad Hacker,1/1/06,12/31/10,"$138,744 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-0545399,Collaborative Research: Earthscope intergrated investigation of Cascadia subduction zone tremor structure and process,We propose an integrated Earthscope field experiment in the Cascadia subduction zone to elucidate the relationship between water transport aseismic slip episodic tremor and arc magmatism. Globally Cascadia represents an end-member of subduction in that some of the youngest and warmest lithosphere on Earth is being subducted leading to predictions that the downgoing plate is dehydrating at unusually shallow depth. Nevertheless a volcanic arc exists with abundant H2O in some magmas indicating that there must exist pathways by which H2O travels through the entire subduction system. Our ultimate aim is to explore the processing of H2O in subduction zones using the tools of seismology geodesy and petrology and to integrate these results with complementary constraints from geodynamics and geochemistry. Seismic imaging will illuminate the descending oceanic plate where it metamorphoses and illuminate the mantle wedge where fluids may be producing hydrous phases such as serpentine or beneath the volcanic arc primary magmas. We design our experiment to traverse the one part of the Cascadia system where earthquakes extend to nearly 100 km depth so we can investigate the relationship between the release of fluids and the generation of Benioff-zone earthquakes. The transport of fluids may be also a primary driver for episodic tremor and slip (ETS) a phenomenon observed in Cascadia perhaps better than anywhere else on the planet. We will integrate measurements of tremor from known source regions with slip distributions derived from GPS data and existing long-baseline tiltmeters. Together with the proposed seismic imaging these observations will yield an unparalleled data set for determining the relationship between tremor slip and the regions where imaging indicates metamorphism of the down-going plate or hydration of the overlying mantle wedge. The basic experiment has four components: a broadband imaging array of flexible-array instruments integrated with Bigfoot three small-aperture seismic arrays near sources of non- volcanic tremor analysis of the PBO and PANGA GPS data sets to define the details of episodic slip events and integrative modeling. The broadband array features a dense transect across the part of the Cascadia subduction system that includes intermediate-depth earthquakes and the Nisqually earthquake hypocenter in a staggered configuration to allow along-strike effects to be tested. That will be complemented by 2 cross lines one crossing the slab where the crust appears to be dehydrating and one in the Cascades foothills to sample the roots of the arc. The tremor and GPS arrays are collocated with the broadband imaging as much as possible to allow simultaneous location of tremor and slip and imaging of their source region. These data will be subject to the gamut of analyses appropriate to such data including array analysis for wave-front orientation of tremor waves migration of teleseismic scattered waves tomographic images of Vp Vs and Q shear-wave splitting earthquake relocation investigation of high-frequency phases interacting with the slab and specialized GPS processing designed for the detection and quantification of transient events. The interpretations will be made in conjunction with detailed petrological‚Äì thermal models of the Cascadia subduction system. These results will place new constraints on the dehydration pathways within the down-going plate the relationship between structure and seismicity at intermediate depths the relationship between transient strain events and structure the temperature melt and volatile content of the mantle wedge and the growth of continental crust.,2006,2010

A Case Study of the Pamir,Continent collisions past and present are studied to understand their influences on plate driving forces the refining of the continental crust geochemical recycling topography climate change etc. For many years and for good reasons Tibet has been the preferred site of study. Tibet however has one significant limitation: it has few exposures of Cenozoic lower crustal rocks. In contrast the Pamir the western extension of the Tibetan Plateau has multiple domes s exposing Cenozoic lower crustal rocks. The Pamir thus present an important opportunity for understanding the role of the lower crust in continent collisions. This proposal focuses on determining how the lower crust thickened and grew during the Cenozoic evolution of the Pamir with the expectation that these findings will apply to continent collisions in general. There are two endmember models for crustal thickening and growth during collision a ‚Äòbrittle‚Äô model el based on folding and imbrication of the crust and subduction of mantle lithosphere and a ‚Äòductile‚Äô model that calls upon large-scale flow of the lower crust in response to gravitational potential energy gradients. We can test these models in the Pamir within the framework of three hypotheses: The Pamir lower crust was 1) thickened and exhumed by local intracontinental shortening during the Cenozoic 2) thickened by Cenozoic long-distance flow and exhumed by local intracontinental shortening during the Cenozoic or 3) thickened and exhumed mostly before the India‚ÄìAsia collision. These hypotheses can be evaluated by studying the Pamir domes and measuring the distribution in space and time of ages of magmatism ages of crustal thickening ages of exhumation depths of exhumation and deformation associated with formation and exhumation of the domes. This is a collaborative work: UCSB researchers will use U/Pb dating of zircon to determine crystallization ages of plutons Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd dating to measure crustal thickening ages and thermobarometry to determine exhumation depths; Freiberg researchers will use 40Ar/39Ar fission-track and (U-Th)/He/He dating to constrain thermal histories and conduct structural analysis to determine the deformation histories of the domes.,2009,2013
Brad Hacker,6/1/11,5/31/15,"$266,136 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1008760,Collaborative Research: The Suturing Process: Insight from the India-Asia Collision Zone,The suturing of continental fragments following the subduction of intervening oceanic lithosphere is a fundamental process in lithospheric dynamics and the shaping and growth of Earth‚Äôs continents. However our understanding of this fundamental process remains limited. Can we use geological observations in some particularly well-exposed suture zones to make general statements about how landscapes and sedimentary basins evolve during suturing? What geodynamic processes lead to decreases in plate convergence rate? Are Mediterranean-style rollback of remnant oceanic lithosphere and opening of marginal oceanic basins characteristic of all or most pre-climax collision zones? Do presuturing ophiolite obduction and intraoceanic arc‚Äì continental margin interactions leave predictable signatures in suture zones? How is the upper continental plate preconditioned by pre-suturing tectonism and how does the upper plate evolve during the transition from oceanic to continental subduction? Is there a predictable mode of deformation in the downgoing continental plate? And what do we expect the balance to be among continental subduction and erosive removal of mass from a collisional orogenic system? We propose to address such questions through a 4-year investigation of the archetypal India‚ÄìAsia collision zone (IACZ) in southern Tibet that involves 19 investigators and 14 graduate students from 9 different institutions. Techniques to be employed include structural geology stratigraphy geochronology thermochronology stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry igneous and metamorphic petrology paleomagnetism and geodynamical modeling. We aim to determine the: (1) evolution of paleogeography and paleoelevation during the transition from oceanic subduction to mature continental collision; (2) geodynamic processes that caused marked decreases in India‚Äì Asia convergence rate; (3) role of Mediterranean-style opening and closing of marginal basins prior to terminal collision; (4) metamorphic evolution of lower-plate (Indian) rocks in response to ophiolite emplacement possible intra-oceanic arc collision and continent collision; (5) role of pre-collisional Andean-style magmatism and deformation in preconditioning the upper-plate lithosphere and how this Andean-style system evolved during continent collision; (6) paleogeography of the Neo-Tethys margins and the history of subduction exhumation thickening and underthrusting/rollback of Greater Indian continental lithosphere; and (7) spatial pattern magnitude and history of erosion and sediment dispersal. Our aims are ambitious but feasible because of the presence of rich but as yet untapped geological records of appropriate age (Cretaceous to Miocene) adjacent to and within the India‚ÄìAsia suture zone. Geodynamical modeling of suturing processes will run in parallel with the geological studies; this vital effort will help guide the evolving project. Whereas the IACZ will be used as our lab we expect that our project deliverables (3-D pre- syn- and post-suturing reconstructions at the lithosphere scale) will provide fresh well-constrained and testable ideas about the suturing process and its role in continental crustal genesis.,2011,2015

We used optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to measure snow grain geometry and chemical composition. Our findings agree with laboratory experiments and sintering theory. Because of the time required for sampling and microscopy we sampled in just two locations. We now plan to extend our sampling to learn how stratigraphy and sintering vary spatially. Other studies we recently published examine how spatial variability is the driving mechanism that produces power laws in avalanche depth distributions. We will use a new method near-infrared digital photography for rapid quantitative stratigraphy and to cover the range of variability over a large mountain. We will apply this technique to snow stability evaluation and the general study of snow metamorphism. Since the measurement of snow properties with near-infrared photography is a new technique it has not been widely used and there are no peer-reviewed studies that apply it to snow stability. While the heterogeneity of grain sizes at the snow surface has been investigated with remote sensing there are many fewer studies of the heterogeneity of snow properties in buried layers especially at the slope scale. Our experience extensive instrumentation site accessibility and large number of avalanche control records make our field location Mammoth Mountain an ideal site to test how near-infrared photography can be used for avalanche hazard evaluation. We will relate mechanical strength to specific signs of instability called lemons i.e. yellow flags. We propose that four of five common lemons can be identified with nearinfrared photography alone. We will also use spatial statistics and machine-learning techniques to classify stable and unstable near- infrared snow profiles.

The revised work plan will enable us to continue to push forward our work in this very important and very poorly known region. It will allow us to continue an ongoing very committed collaboration with Mexican colleagues from UNAM Luca Ferrari (since 2007) and Elena Centeno-Garcia (since 2005). The research is as follows: 1. We will digitally compile and synthesize all previous available work including unpublished maps and field data held by McDowell at UT Austin and integrate it with the new results obtained by this study (see below). We will then interpret these data in the context of rapidly- evolving models for the origin of silicic large igneous provinces and publish our findings. This will enable us to move forward with a well informed field plan once the security situation improves in Chihuahua. 2. We will perform Hf O and U-Pb isotopic analysis of zircons from several sites in the northern SMO to gain insight into the origin of the magmas in this world-class silicic large igneous province. This work will be done in close collaboration with Luca Ferrari who is doing the same kind of work on his samples from the southern SMO with Scott Bryan. Ferrari is very interested in this work and is giving us a very good price to do the Hf and U-Pb analytical work at Juriquilla; the total comes to about half the in-house rate for Busby at UCSB and substantially less than the rate posted on the University of Arizona website.

Insight From the Himalaya-Tibet System,This research involves target fieldwork aimed at lithotectonic and structural characterization and specimen collection. Detailed structural mapping of faults and shear zones and analysis of spatial variations in strain paths followed by rocks within the Main Central thrust system will follow the approach previously applied by the P.I.‚Äôs to other structures in the Himalaya (e.g. Cottle et al. 2007 2009a b; Kellett & Godin 2009; Kellett et al. 2009 2010; Larson and Godin 2009; Larson et al. 2010a; Jessup & Cottle 2010). Macro- scale structural mapping will include documentation of all standard fabrics with an emphasis on lineations high-strain domains melt-associated deformation as well as boudins flanking structures and over-printing relationships. Shear sense and deformation temperatures will be characterized through both micro-structural analysis (following the methods of e.g. Hirth and Tullis (1992)) and through optical and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of crystal lattice preferred orientations (LPO) and the asymmetry of [c] and <a> axes patterns in quartz and feldspar grains (following e.g. Law et al. 1990 and Kruhl 1998). Diffraction patterns will be collected using an FEI Quanta 400 FEG scanning electron microscope coupled with a HKL Nordlys 2 EBSD camera at UCSB. Timing constraints on deformation within structures identified in the field will come from U(- Th)-Pb dating of 1) intrusive bodies that either cut or are deformed by the shear zones (Figure 3C); and 2) metamorphic monazite that can be texturally linked to pre- syn- and post-kinematic porphyroblasts (see thermobarometry and metamorphic ages sections). The distribution of deformation domains will provide important information regarding the spatial variations in fabric development during the evolution of the Greater Himalaya series-Main Central thrust system and the relative importance of distributed versus focused (e.g. shear zone) deformation. Within the context of the models proposed Hypothesis 1 predicts that deformation will be concentrated in the vicinity of the major thrust faults. Furthermore deformation temperatures attained would be expected to decrease abruptly down structural section. In contrast Hypothesis 2 predicts that deformation is pervasive throughout the rocks to be examined and that all rocks were deformed at high temperatures; any change in deformation temperature should be gradational. Thus understanding the distribution of deformation and its relative and absolute timing and duration of movement will provide a direct test of the competing models. In either case this study will provide a detailed account of structures including microstructural characteristics and vorticity both of which provide significant constraints on the structural evolution of the Himalayan front.,2011,2015

We plan to use several 10Be samples on modern sediment and divide the remaining 10Be samples between two sections of the stratigraphy that show the best opportunity for developing a high-resolution record of paleo-erosion rates. Such sections will be characterized by well-resolved paleomagnetic reversals anchored by new tephrachronology with high-resolution U- Pb zircon ages. As mentioned above we will likely focus on a 1.2-Myr interval between 7.4 ‚Äì 6.2 Ma which is currently bracketed by two ashes and contains 7 reversals. Nine additional samples in this interval would provide a resolution of ~1 sample per 100 kyr capable of resolving 400-kyr cyclicity. An additional 11 samples would then be collected from a ~100 kyr long interval allowing a nominal resolution of ~8.3 kyr per sample capable of resolving variations as short as 23 ka. For comparison we would like to repeat the above sampling strategy on a ~ 1-Myr-long interval in the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene after the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation at ~ 2.8 Ma. The 20 additional 10Be samples focused on this interval would be paired with 26Al and 21Ne analyses in the same samples in an effort to implement the full 3-isotope approach described above. 5-10 of these 21Ne analyses will be paired with 10Be samples to develop a cross-calibration and compute nucleogenic 21Ne whereas the remaining 10-15 21Ne samples will be used to extend the low-resolution record back as far as 12 Ma.,2012,2015
Ralph Archuleta Chen Ji,9/1/12,8/31/14,"$359,859 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1215769,Improving Resolution of Finite Inversions With Increasing Bandwidth,This project will develop new methods of inverting observations to provide more resolved and robust estimates kinematic rupture models. Without direct measurements of the fault during an earthquake the spatio-temporal evolution of the slip on the fault must be inferred from seismic geodetic and geologic observations. While the representation theorem provides the link between the spatio-temporal evolution and the observations the inverse problem has been a quagmire. The number of parameters needed to infer the details of a rupture is much larger than the number of available data i.e. the inverse problem is underdetermined. By itself that is a problem. When coupled with the fact that the temporal variables (rise time and rupture time) are not linearly related to the observations additional complexities arise in the methods for inverting the observations. Nonetheless models of the spatio-temporal evolution of slip i.e. the source process can be found. The quality of these models needs to be quantitatively assessed. As carefully enumerated by Hartzell et al. (2007) each factor from the subfault size to the selection of a misfit norm plays a role in determining a rupture model. Once a model has been determined there is still the question of how uncertain the model parameter is at each point on the fault. There are means of estimating the uncertainty of each parameter as if it were independent of the other parameters. This provides some sense of the uncertainty. One approach is to examine cross-validation i.e. predicting observations that were not used to constrain the inversion and its relationship to the uncertainty of the kinematic model. The question is not the misfit between the predictions and observations rather it is quantifying the difference between different models‚Äî uncertainty of the parameters on the fault. Many different models are found that are equally consistent with the data. A key point is that the faulting model should satisfy all of the data. While inversion methods continue to be improved with new measures of uncertainty in the models the factor that has led to the largest reduction in the space of models is the addition of new data. This is more than adding stations though that is useful but it is adding data that are independent such as GPS or InSAR. The data that exists and have not been fully exploited are the high-frequency seismic data. These data provide important constraints on stress drops and variations in rupture velocity. By using these data in concert with low-frequency seismograms GPS and InSAR the resulting kinematic models will be better resolved and more robust. Two methods are proposed for exploiting the high-frequency data. First using back projection areas on the fault that produce high-frequency radiation are identified. Using a multiscale inversion the parameters are resolved on a finer scale and used as constraints on the inversion at a larger scale. Second derivatives of the acceleration envelope function are inverted to determine regions of high-frequency radiation. These regions will also be subject to multi-scale inversion to constrain the overall inversions. In combination the two methods will improve the resolution and robustness of the inverted rupture model.,2012,2014

The goal of the work proposed here is to generate a statistically rigorous timeline for the appearances of skeletal animals during the first ~25 million years of the Cambrian (Nemakit- Daldynian and Tommotian stages). It will build on earlier work by PIs Maloof and Porter and their collaborators that used radiometrically calibrated carbon isotope chemostratigraphy to reconstruct the pattern of appearances through this interval at two million year resolution. That work suggested that the diversification of skeletal animals began early and extended throughout this interval, with pulses of appearances ca. 540–538 Ma, 534–530 Ma, and 524–522 Ma. However, it is not clear to what extent preservational biases and uncertainties in correlation and dating have influenced these patterns. This research effort will use recently developed statistical methods to address these concerns. In particular, it will (1) use a new method developed by PI Wang and colleagues to estimate a confidence interval for the duration of the diversification (and thus provide an estimate of its rate), and (2) use both a randomization procedure and a new method developed by Wang and an undergraduate student to identify the most likely number of pulses of origination and their timing. As a side benefit, this work will also provide estimates of the time of origination for the skeletal genera in the database, as well as estimates of recovery potential and diversity curves. Finally, this work will fund ongoing efforts by PIs Maloof and Porter and graduate student Moore to augment the dataset, currently composed of 150 skeletal genera from 24 sections in China, Mongolia, and Siberia, with the eventual goal of extending coverage to later Cambrian time.",2013,2015

To accomplish this we will study erosion patterns in and around deep canyons on the Colorado Plateau in relation to channel steepness patterns and rock properties. Important to our approach is the concept that the spatial structure of short-term erosion rates in disequilibrium landscapes like the Colorado Plateau reflects the longer-term temporal history of mainstem river incision. Not only do the canyons and surrounding landscapes of the Colorado Plateau provide an excellent natural laboratory for this investigation but their study also carries significant broader impact and public education potential because of the iconic status of the Grand Canyon and the recent high profile debate over the antiquity of this dramatic landform (age estimates range from <6 Ma to >60 Ma). Despite the fundamental and long-recognized importance of lithology in landscape evolution it has received little attention in the quantitative studies of landscape evolution in recent decades. Partly this is because we have lacked the ability to quantitatively measure rock strength at the process scale and partly because until recently lacked firm theory to relate rock properties to river incision processes ‚Äì limitations that can now be overcome. We address three fundamental problems of broad interest to Geologists and Geomorphologists: (1) the role of lithology in river incision and landscape evolution in general (2) how lithologic variability affects and limits our ability to interpret river incision history from study of landforms and (3) the controversial incision history of river canyons in the Colorado Plateau. The back drop to our study is the enigmatic Late Cenozoic exhumation history of the Colorado Plateau but although our results should contribute to solving this long-standing problem it is not our focus. We frame our study around three testable hypotheses concerning the fundamental controls on landscape evolution encoded in canyon landscapes and the last ~1 Myr of river incision history. Given the icon nature of the Grand Canyon and the vast number of tourists that visit the canyon each year public education is essential especially when geoscience educators use National Parks as case studies for teaching exercises. As part of this research we will pursue a geoscience education study (part of the graduate student‚Äôs time commitment) of the effectiveness of using field analogs to teach about geologic process and landscape evolution specifically related to canyon incision and relief generation. Folks living on reservation land on the Colorado Plateau are a key target audience. In addition to our public outreach efforts the proposed study will provide significant training for one graduate student and several undergraduates. All students will interact with the PIs and institutions providing educational experiences for each student that are not typical. Specifically this research will enhance the opportunities for undergraduates for direct involvement in cutting-edge research. We will proactively recruit women and underrepresented minorities.,2013,2015
Matthew Jackson,8/1/14,7/31/17,"$8,783 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1347377,Collaborative Research: The role of oxygen fugacity in calc-alkaline differentiation and the creation of continental crust at the Aleutian arc,Geochemical exchanges between the Earth‚Äôs surface and interior at subduction zones drive major changes in magmatic composition that potentially generate Earth‚Äôs continental crust. Among the key characteristics shared by bulk continental crust and some subduction zone magmas is calc-alkaline affinity a rapid draw-down in Fe concentration early in a magma‚Äôs cooling history. Most hypotheses for explaining calc-alkaline differentiation from a primary magma invoke a combination of the effects of elevated H2O and oxygen fugacity (fO2) both of which are common in arc magmas on the early solid phase assemblage when arc magmas begin to crystallize. The relative importance of H2O fO2 and magmatic bulk composition in generating calc-alkaline magmas however remains an outstanding and important question. Moreover although the elevated H2O contents of arc magmas are generally thought to derive from the subducted lithosphere no such consensus has been reached for the cause of elevated fO2 in arc magmas. Contrasting models link oxidizing processes either to an oxidizing flux from the subducted plate concomitant with (though not directly caused by) the addition of H2O or to an oxidizing process in the overriding plate (e.g. crystallization degassing) through which magmas pass before eruption. Resolving the key roles that H2O fO2 and magmatic bulk composition play will have important implications for models of how Earth‚Äôs continents initially formed and have grown through time. Lavas of varying calc- alkaline affinity from strongly calc-alkaline to mildly tholeiitic erupt along the Aleutian arc making it an ideal natural laboratory for constraining the petrogenesis of these magma types. This study will provide critical new constraints on the fO2 of variably calcalkaline magmas in the Aleutian arc and explore how fO2 is linked to magmatic H2O contributions from the subducted plate and various differentiation processes through the combined study of melt inclusions whole-rocks and petrological experiments. To do this we will measure dissolved volatiles Fe3+/Œ£Fe ratios and isotopic signatures of melt inclusions and/or whole-rocks from the Eastern and Western Aleutians and pair these natural studies with experimental constraints on the effects of H2O fO2 and bulk composition on the phase equilibria of Aleutian parental magmas.,2014,2017

However the fate of the subducted package--oceanic crust and sediment--in the mantle is poorly understood. A long-standing hypothesis maintains that subducted materials residue in the mantle for an extended but unknown period of time and are then recycled back to the Earth's surface in regions of buoyantly upwelling mantle and melted beneath hotspots. If this hypothesis is correct ocean island basalts (OIB) erupted at hotspots should exhibit geochemical signatures associated with the crustal protoliths that were injected into the mantle at a subduction zone in the geologic past. However it has been difficult to unequivocally detect geochemical signatures of ancient subducted materials in hotspot lavas. This project will use measurements of mass independently fractionated sulfur (MIF-S) isotope signatures--made using two complementary techniques--in key hotspot lavas to trace crustal cycling from the surface through the mantle and back again.,2014,2015

Because of the acute reduction in vegetation and organic matter soils burned by fire lose cohesion and infiltration capacity. Along with enhanced soil water repellency runoff and flooding potential are elevated years after fire. Post-fire hydrologic and sedimentologic responses are extremely complex varying with burn severity rainfall regimes geophysical characteristics and vegetation recovery. Although researchers have studied these processes for more than 70 years predicting post-fire effects remains elusive and physically-based models of post-fire runoff and erosion are not yet complete. Part of the difficulty is that temporal windows for observing post-fire effects are comparatively short with direct measurements tending to span only part of the recovery period (typically less than three years). Equally important are longer-term perspectives however in regards to how wildfire impacts Earth surface processes in the context of landscape evolution. Developing predictive understanding of both short- and long-term effects is critical to the future of our planet especially in an era of changing climates that have increased frequencies and magnitudes of wildfires. This proposed RAPID project focuses on production and delivery of dry ravel a characteristic and immediate post-fire response on steep slopes in the western USA. Dry ravel is a dry-season erosion process whereby gravel sediment moving down hillslopes by gravity becomes trapped by vegetation. Burning vegetation releases this sediment enabling its accumulation at margins of ephemeral channels. Dry ravel therefore provides a significant source of sediment into river channels after fire in chaparral environments. The investigators will quantify the volume of dry ravel sediment derived from the recent Springs Fire that burned Big Sycamore Canyon in southern California during May 2013 Using Terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) augmented by field surveys. Additionally the investigators have geomorphic data spanning over 25 years for Big Sycamore Canyon and two comparable basins nearby with different fire histories. Thus comparing the dry ravel processes at these three sites will enable a compelling story of both short- and long-term sediment dynamics following wildfire in chaparral environments. These data are critical toward developing models of the dynamics of dry ravel for further development and testing.,2013,2015
Matthew Jackson,9/2/13,1/31/15,"$99,395 ",National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,EAR-1430610,Isotopic diversity in Mangaia melt inclusions: Mantle source or crustal assimilation?,Olivine-hosted melt inclusions (‚Äúinclusions‚Äù hereafter) are trapped by growing phenocrysts in magma conduits at depth and provide ‚Äúsnapshots‚Äù of diverse melt compositions before complete melt aggregation. Inclusions reveal major and trace element diversity that is not clear from analyses of whole rock lavas alone and the origin of this diversity continues to be a source of vigorous debate. One end member hypothesis is that the diversity in inclusions reflects heterogeneity in mantle source compositions. Alternatively the diversity of inclusion compositions may result from magmatic processes including crustal assimilation. In a groundbreaking discovery extreme Pb-isotopic variability‚Äîspanning 50% of the range identified in global ocean island and MORB lavas‚Äîwas measured in olivine hosted melt inclusions from a single lava collected from the island of Mangaia (Cook Austral Islands). While many of the Mangaia inclusions host a Pb-isotopic component similar to lavas from the island a surprising result was that some inclusions host less radiogenic Pb-isotopic ratios never before seen in Mangaian lavas. The origin of the Pb isotopic diversity in these inclusions is not well understood and the discovery of isotopic variability gave rise to a host of fundamental questions. Why is it that the inclusions are not isotopically representative of the bulk magma? Is it because inclusions from a single lava trap melts from isotopically-diverse mantle sources? Or does the isotopic diversity reflect assimilation of the lithosphere during magma ascent? Unfortunately bulk abundances of elements most sensitive to crustal assimilation (like B Cl and K) have never been paired with Pb-isotopic compositions in the same inclusions from Mangaia. As a result it has not been possible to evaluate whether the Pb-isotopic variability in Mangaia inclusions relates to mantle source variability or crustal assimilation. In an attempt to evaluate the origin of the isotopic variability in inclusions from Mangaia the PI used start-up funds to undertake a pilot study with his student (Ms. Rita Cabral) in which 14 inclusions from Mangaia were analyzed for major trace and volatile elements. The data from the pilot study are intriguing and hint at a possible role for crustal assimilation. However the data are limited and robust conclusions cannot be drawn without additional data and mantle source variability is possible. In particular Pb-isotopic measurements on the inclusions are necessary to determine whether proxies for crustal assimilation relate to the Pb-isotopic variability. Thus this proposal seeks funding to make additional measurements to test the following hypotheses: 1.) If the Pb isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions is a result of crustal assimilation processes the Pb-isotopic compositions will correlate with indices of assimilation (e.g. high Cl and B). 2.) Alternatively the isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions reflects diverse mantle sources beneath Mangaia that contribute isotopically-heterogeneous melts to inclusions. To test these hypotheses this proposal seeks funding to measure 87Sr/86Sr (which is also sensitive to assimilation of seawater and crustal materials) and Pb isotopic ratios and major trace and volatile abundances in the same inclusions and expand the study to include a larger suite of inclusions from three Mangaia lavas. The proposed measurements will constrain the relative roles of magmatic processes and mantle sources in generating heterogeneous inclusions and will be important for understanding magma transport and emplacement processes in the lithosphere.,2013,2015

Microenvironments have played critical roles in rapid vegetation response to past climate change such as the emergence from the last glacial maximum. This project tests the importance of these difficult-to-model features in vegetation response to future climate change. The overarching research question addressed is """"How does macroecological response to climate change emerge from finer scale climate and population processes?"" The project uses a combination of modeling and field experimentation to answer this question. A collaborative research team will model microenvironment impacts on species distribution abundance and diversity under rapid climate change for four tree species across four study sites in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges of California. This proposed research design is a novel combination of site trials distribution models and population models incorporating measured (rather than inferred) species' tolerances relevant to microenvironments at scales that vary over five orders of magnitude (30m-3000km). Analytical tools will include reciprocal transplant experiments field surveys species trait-based distribution models population models and biogeographic models of climate change. Physical models of microenvironments are linked to models of tree species occupation of microenvironments which in turn inform models of population-level responses. Climate change is simulated using Regional Earth Systems Models and statistical downscaling from global climate model simulations. Field experiments examine the response of establishment phase (seedling) dynamics the life history stage most sensitive to altered climate through transplanting protocols to lower (warmer) elevations. The frequency of fire in the landscape is projected using correlations of fire to landscape conditions under current climate. Establishment phase and fire information is then used in models of single species population responses and multi-taxa responses in complex landscapes. These population-level models will give clear indication of whether microenvironments change species dynamics in rapid climate change in ways that will dramatically change range-wide and continental-scale biological responses to climate change.",2011,2016

Trading partners will likely include power companies POTWs regulators and non-point sources. Other key stakeholders will include but not limited to conservation and environmental organizations as well as constituent interest groups. Program design will require intensive stakeholder involvement over three to five years. The design of the trading framework will be shaped by several attributes that will constrain the overall program.

Although there are 85 water quality trading programs in the U.S. there are no peer-reviewed protocols to ensure these programs will achieve the promised in-stream benefits which creates liability for power companies who purchase those credits for permit compliance. This will be the first attempt to raise the caliber of WQ crediting protocols and may result in the only peer- reviewed publication demonstrating a scientifically-informed crediting approach. Water quality trading (WQT) is a flexible tool offering a mechanism to achieve additional economic and environmental benefits when used in conjunction with traditional command and control approaches for managing water quality in the United States. Analogous to carbon credit trading a permitted discharger facing high costs to accommodate new growth or meet more stringent water quality limits can ‚Äútrade‚Äù for credits generated by another source having lower costs (e.g. an agricultural producer implementing conservation practices). EPRI is spearheading the pilot testing of the largest WQT program in the world in the Ohio River Basin. During the implementation of this project one scientific gap in has become apparent: the absence of a rigorous scientifically-based crediting protocol. This effort will follow the successful model of EPRI‚Äôs Nitrous Oxide Protocol which lead to the first peer-reviewed carbon crediting protocol to be submitted to the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) verification process (Climate Program Adam Diamant). While water quality trading still lacks an analogous body such as VCS for verifying the crediting system we believe that the only way to ensure that any WQT program stands on solid footing is to base it on a strong defensible scientific method. Without a scientifically robust crediting protocol the viability of WQT being accessible to power companies is seriously limited. The reason for this is that in WQT the credit buyer retains full liability for demonstrating that the purchased credits achieve the intended water benefits. If the credits fail (the credit seller fails to implement the necessary actions to generate in-stream benefits) the buyer will be liable by way of not be in compliance with their NPDES permit. The buyer will be subject to punishment for not meeting their permit limit. The seller will not be subject to disciplinary action. (This is contrast to carbon species or wetland credit markets where the buyer is absolved of all future liability after purchasing credits). While there are 85 WQT programs in the U.S power companies will not have the confidence to participate in these markets without more defensible crediting protocols. Therefore this effort if funded may break through the barriers for the power industry to use WQT to cost-effectively meet their water quality effluent permit limits.,2012,2012

The Service intends to use these funds to conduct restoration that will benefit the California red-legged frog, California tiger salamander, and other trust resources. Biological surveys were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s in support of EPA’s ecological risk assessment and remedial investigation. Updated surveys are necessary in order to determine current usage of the site by our trust resources, and to best guide the use of the limited settlement dollars available to conduct restoration. The Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office proposes to use the requested funding to conduct surveys for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander in strategic locations within the site and surrounding habitats to determine current usage of the site by these species. Surveys for California red-legged frogs were previously conducted in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Surveys for California tiger salamanders were conducted in 2002/2003, and 2004/2005. California red-legged frogs were detected in all survey efforts with the exception of 2004. California tiger salamanders were detected during drift fence surveys in 2004/2005. Because California tiger salamander surveys have never been replicated at the site in the six years since the species was detected, and because the species is so acutely imperiled within Santa Barbara County, information about presence or absence of the species at the Casmalia Resources site would be invaluable. In addition, previous surveys for California tiger salamanders 210 established presence of metamorphosed individuals in upland habitat, but the extent of California tiger salamander breeding in aquatic resources at the site remains unknown. The trend in observations of California red-legged frogs throughout the 1998 to 2004 study period demonstrated a rapid decline from over 50 individuals detected in 1998 to no individuals detected in 2003 or 2004. The absence of California red-legged frogs in 2003 and 2004 is suspected to be associated with low water levels in the stormwater ponds due to pumping of water for the construction of a landfill cap, and increasing total dissolved solids (TDS) in the stormwater ponds. The water level in all ponds is currently high relative to 2003/2004, however TDS remains high and the use of the ponds by California red-legged frogs and California tiger salamanders is unknown. It is likely that the high TDS is creating an attractive nuisance for the California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs attempting to breed at the site. This project will evaluate the need for (through aquatic and upland surveys) and feasibility of, creating additional breeding ponds at the site to provide suitable breeding habitat away from areas with high TDS. Ponds will subsequently be created as deemed appropriate and monitored in subsequent years. The proposed surveys will assist the Service in providing technical assistance to EPA during the remedial process, and implementing restoration for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander. Updated information about the use of the site by California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs will support the Service’s effort to work with EPA in evaluating and selecting a remedy that would provide maximum habitat for trust resources and understand the use of the site be these species. The study will be conducted in phases to achieve the overall objectives of the study.",2012,2017

California tiger salamanders are known to occur off of VAFB along Hwy 246 and near Casmalia (Sweet pers comm.) Surveys for CTS on VAFB in 2001 and 2003 were inconclusive because of the dry weather during the survey years. During dry years, CTS may not emerge and breed in pools. In 2008, the habitat capability of pools for CTS were assessed by a member of the Recovery Team, Professor Samuel Sweet of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Sweet assessed the pools based on ecological requirements of the species. For pools to be suitable, they must remain wet for a prolonged period, long enough to develop a prey base for the larval CTS. For pools to be occupied, they need to have surrounding habitat through which salamanders can disperse. The probability of occupancy increases in pools within 2 miles of occupied habitat off base. Suitable dispersal habitat needed microenvironments which were cool or shaded with gradual slopes down to the pools. The surrounding area of the pools needed friable soils or burrows which could shelter adult CTS during the nonbreeding season or years. In 2008, hoop-net and seine net samples of pools were conducted after pools had been inundated for about a month. No CTS were observed by these methods although samples were only taken once at each pool. The pools with suitable dispersal habitat had drift nets and pittraps installed; the drift nets will channel approaching CTS towards the pit traps. These traps were installed during the dry season and kept closed. Coverboards were also placed in areas with suitable dispersal and breeding habitat. Locations of coverboards and pools with driftnets were noted on GIS. 209 Also, in 2008, surveys near VAFB noted whether the introduced barred salamander were present. Barred salamanders were noted in many areas, including the penitentiary pond and near Rucker Road next to La Purisima Mission. The close proximity of the barred salamanders highlights the conservation concerns for CTS. Barred salamanders may also be present on VAFB.",2009,2010

Chen Ji,1/1/09,12/31/10,"$64,766 ",US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,G09AP00023,Global Earthquake Characterization on irregular fault surfaces Collaborative Research with UCSB and USGS,Recent developments in global broadband seismic instrumentation and in inverse methods have made it possible to routinely study the earthquake slip history based on teleseismic observations and proceed to predict the local damage [e.g. Ji et al. 2004]. However fast finite fault solutions were generally limited by the simple parameterization to the fault geometry i.e. planar fault planes with constant fault strike and dip angles inferred from point source CMT solutions. Considering the down-dip variation of the fault dip angle and using a more appropriate velocity structure usually reshapes the inverted slip distribution and sometimes ends up a multiple times difference in inverted slip e.g. the 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake. Correct representation of fault geometry is also crucial for predicting the local damage and tsunami excitation. Attempts have been made to predefine the fault geometry using relocated seismic catalog and moment tensors [Hayes and Wald 2008]. But it is still lack of finite fault inverse algorithm which could easily incorporate the irregular fault plane. In a pilot study supported by the USGS we are developing the feasible mesh algorithm to consider the complex fault geometry. Here we propose to improve the solutions of quick finite fault inversion procedure and the tsunami predicting capability by considering the effect of the irregular fault surfaces.,2009,2010
Ralph Archuleta,1/1/09,12/31/10,"$73,921 ",US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,G09AP00027,Strong Ground Motions in Salt Lake City and Other Metropolitan Areas From Large Earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault,Nearly 80% of the population of Utah lives near the Wasatch fault (Utah Geological Survey 1996). The metropolitan areas of Salt Lake City and Provo/Orem are among the most hazardous regions of the United States (USGS 1998). Besides the question: When will the next large earthquake occur? The most important question is: What will the ground motion be? Large earthquakes even moderate sized events are relatively rare on the Wasatch fault. The geological setting‚Äîwhere most of the infrastructure and the population are sitting on alluvial filled valleys‚Äî exacerbates the situation. We propose to mitigate the seismic risk by using dynamic and kinematic simulations of different earthquake scenarios to derive estimates of the expected ground motion from large earthquakes on the Wasatch fault. These simulations will account for: 1) geometry of the fault 2) the velocity structure in particular the 3D structure with sediments juxtaposed against the granite of the mountains 3) topography 4) heterogeneous stress on the fault and 5) physics of the constitutive laws for friction. Many different earthquake scenarios based on different hypocenters and variations of the input parameters will be simulated in order to determine the range of the ground motion. These simulations will provide ground motion for frequencies up to 1-2 Hz. We will make use of the extensive investigations already done for the Wasatch fault that document the geometry of the fault active tectonics and the velocity and attenuation structure. Recent USGS funded projects will provide more details about the 3D velocity structure as well as the near-surface velocities for some limited regions. Professor Robert Smith University of Utah has been either directly or indirectly involved with most of the studies that provide these basic data. We have used the 3D community velocity model and the USGS description of the fault geometry as the baseline for our simulations. We have incorporated these features in our initial simulations of the dynamics of a spontaneously propagating fracture. We use the finite element code MAFE [Ma and Beroza 2008; Ma and Archuleta 2006; Ma et al. 2007] to simulate dynamic ruptures on dipping faults. The dynamics includes heterogeneous stress conditions and a slip weakening constitutive law for friction that couples the heterogeneous stresses on the fault with the elastic response during a spontaneous shear fracture. While this method includes the realistic effects of geology fault structure and the physics of a spontaneously propagating shear fracture the ground motion is computationally limited to frequencies less than 1-2 Hz. To extend the frequency range to higher frequencies ~10-20 Hz we will collaborate with Professor Jacobo Bielak Carnegie Mellon University who has developed a hierarchical finite element method that can take our dynamic results of faulting as input to a kinematic model and propagate the motion to higher frequencies. With many different faulting scenarios there will be many different ground motion maps. The purpose of the project is to estimate the range of ground motion that should be expected from a MW ~7 earthquake on the Wasatch Fault. Preliminary results for normal faulting earthquakes show that the ground motion on the hanging wall (the side of the fault where most of population resides) has large ground motion and long duration due both to the proximity of the fault plane and the sediment filled basin. The largest amplitudes are within ¬±5 km of the fault trace with the largest amplitudes on the vertical component. Basically we have very limited direct knowledge of what to expect from a large normal-faulting earthquake. Through simulations of many scenario earthquakes that include realistic geological structure and fault geometries we will provide robust estimates for the expected ground motion from a MW~7 earthquake on the Wasatch fault.,2009,2010

It is the best-recorded normal faulting earthquake in terms of near-source accelerograms. Additionally it has static field measurements that include both GPS and InSAR. There are 17 strong motion accelerographs within 50 km of the surface projection of the fault. Among them 10 are within 20 km and four accelerographs are on the hanging wall above the fault plane. Prior to this earthquake there were very few near-source accelerograms for normal faulting earthquakes. In the Next Generation of Attenuation relations Excel spreadsheet that has the metadata for the accelerograms [Chiou et al. 2008] only 12 normal-faulting earthquakes (MW 6.0) are listed; from these events there are only 28 strong motion records within 50 km of the fault. Thus the results of this work will be an important addition to the dataset of normal faulting earthquakes. The basic objective of this proposed research is to invert the strong motion regional seismograms GPS vectors and InSAR data to determine the kinematic parameters that describe the faulting. We will then use that faulting model to predict the broadband ground motion by summing empirical Green‚Äôs functions based on the aftershocks recorded on the accelerographs. For the mainshock we have obtained all of the strong motion data all of the regional broadband seismograms and the regional 3D velocity structure in a 100 km x 100 km area that encompasses the epicentral region. Through our cooperation with Italian scientists (M. Cocco and R. Paolucci) at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) in both Rome and Milano we will obtain the GPS and InSAR data. Focal mechanisms have already been published for the aftershocks with ML 4.0. To get a better description of the velocity structure in the epicentral region we will collaborate with an Italian scientist (G. De Luca) at the National Laboratory of Gran Sasso of National Institut of Nuclear Physics who has been operating a local seismic array in the Aterno Valley and has published on the local velocity structure and site effects. With these data we have the fundamental building blocks to start our analysis. Care has to be taken in various steps of the analysis and multiple approaches are possible for each step. We will explore various approaches and perform comprehensive analysis for this important normalfaulting data set. We will use two different nonlinear inversion methods [Ji et al. 2002; Liu and Archuleta 2004] to invert the data. We will include the static measurements (GPS and InSAR) in a two-step approach vis-aÃÄvis Page et al. [2009] and CustoÃÅdio et al. [2009] and also as a joint inversion vis-aÃÄ-vis Ji et al. [2002]. Given the excellent InSAR data it will be important to determine what constraints it puts on the temporal evolution of the faulting. It is well documented that many different faulting models can produce equally good low-frequency waveform fits to the seismic data. The critical questions revolve around how the velocity structure the station distribution the band-limited data etc. produce uncertainty in the spatial and temporal parameters of the faulting model. We will address these questions as we find the faulting models that are consistent with all the data. The faulting models found by inversions are limited to low frequencies generally a maximum around 1.0 Hz. By using isochrones we will do forensics on the models to evaluate their ability to predict the timing and relative amplitudes of peak velocities and acceleration. This will provide an independent check on the rupture velocity and spatial distribution of slip. To complete the study we will use aftershocks as empirical Green‚Äôs functions. We will sum the empirical Green‚Äôs functions weighted by the slip distribution and with the rupture time that was determined from the inversion. With this approach we can generate broadband synthetic time histories forcomparison with the data. We will use Fourier amplitude spectra and Husid plots to evaluate the comparison between synthetics and the data.,2010,2011
Douglas Burbank,1/1/10,12/31/11,"$57,838 ",US Department of Interior,Federal agencies,G10AP00015,Temporal Patterns of Fault Slip Rates on the Genoa Fault,A deeper understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of faults and the associated seismicity requires knowledge of the timing rate and spatial variation of tectonic processes that control the deformation. A fundamental assumption that underpins many brittle crustal deformation models is that tectonic rates are steady once integrated across a sufficient number of seismic events. Short-term interseismic deformation rates are commonly assumed to be constant across time and space and therefore can be used to predict long-term deformation patterns. We know that this assumption may well be inaccurate on million-year time scales but the ‚Äústeady rate‚Äù assumption remains largely untested at shorter time scales. Thus a tantalizing but unanswered question persists: Do deformation rates accelerate and decelerate at scales of 102 to 105 years? Using an integrated geomorphic-paleoseismic-geodetic approach our team proposes to focus on answering this question in a spatially-restricted and well-mapped region where we can quantify a record of fault-related deformation over the past 103-105 yr along the Genoa fault at the eastern boundary of the central Sierra Nevada California-Nevada. The Genoa fault is experiencing some of the highest strain rates and fastest Holocene slip rates in the western Great Basin. Whereas this fault has been the site of at least two pre-historic Holocene earthquakes M>7 its long-term slip rate history is poorly known. Over 10- to 200-ky time scales our proposed geomorphic approach is to quantify fault displacements of multiple geomorphic features including glacial outwash terraces and alluvial fans and to determine the age of those features using cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) exposure dating techniques. By comparing offsets of different ages along individual fault segments and modeling their slip rates we will define how the locus magnitude and rate of fault slip changes through time. Paleoseismic trench studies (funded by NEHRP through our FY09 proposal) will reduce uncertainty concerning how these geomorphic offsets are produced by fault rupture. Presently funded paleoseismic excavations and mapping were an appropriate first step in constraining strain in this region and this trench data will offer a unique opportunity to compare timing of earthquake events displacement magnitude/event and geometry of underlying faults to the slip- rates calculated from offset geomorphic features (proposed in this study) on the southern segment of the Genoa fault. By integrating geologic and paleoseismic datasets we will be able to investigate what frequency and magnitudes of earthquake rupture were required to build observed geomorphic offsets. These data will be compared to modern geodetic deformation rates from a dense local GPS network in order to test models of the earthquake cycle. Despite numerous past studies the 104-105 yr time span has been poorly explored due either to the paucity of dating techniques with sufficient resolution in this interval or to the absence of datable materials. CRN dating of surface boulders and depth profiles will allow more accurate high-resolution chronologies to be developed for numerous geomorphic features that are deformed by active faults in this temporal (104-105 yr) window. This proposal intentionally focuses on field sites where slip rates are modest (generally 1-3 mm/yr). In such a region the use of multiple displaced markers with high-resolution dates will permit a robust discrimination of temporal changes in fault behavior. On rapidly moving faults temporal resolution is typically insufficient to unambiguously discriminate among such geomorphic displacement rates. Our late Quaternary data will synthesized with Holocene paleoseismic (102-103 yr) and modern geodetic rates in this same region thereby providing tests of key assumptions about the temporal constancy of slip rates.,2010,2011

The US Geological Survey (USGS) Research contracted with the Holden Lab at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) to perform microbial community analysis of water samples in the Fall of 2009 for a prior study of the Malibu Lagoon. Because microbial communities may be altered by the introduction of effluent or wastewater (i.e. via direct inoculation of waste-associated microbes or via introduction of nutrients or other chemicals that could exert selective pressures on indigenous populations) and because microbial communities can be interrogated using culture-independent methods yielding dense datasets (amenable to powerful statistical analysis by multivariate methods) assaying microbial community composition from water samples at suspected impacted positive control and negative control sites can comparatively reveal the degree of impact. The objective of this project was to analyze microbial communities that exist in water samples collected by the USGS at Malibu Lagoon in the spring of 2010. The microbial community analysis data were provided to the USGS for their statistical analysis and for comparison to other datasets they generated. The community analysis approach used here was Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis; additionally one other DNA-based source tracking method (qPCR of a human-specific Bacteriodales gene) and qPCR of Enterococcus sp. were applied to extracted DNA to aid in assessing fecal contamination of the water samples.

GPS location field relations and photographs to indicate the precise location and context of the samples will also be collected.

The proposed tools for this research include U-Th-Pb geochronology in-situ Sm/Nd isotope geochemistry trace element analysis and chemical mapping of xenotime and monazite grains. Sampling strategy: 50 bulk rock samples: host gneisses as well as leucosomes inside and outside of the Th-anomaly and at several of the deposits identified by Evans (1964) will be collected for further analysis during year 1 of the project. In addition 20 alluvial samples will be collected in order to make a reconnaissance assessment over a wider to assess the likely spatial extent of the deposit. Analysis will begin with detailed petrographic thin section analysis of bulk rock samples. From this it will be determined which samples contain sufficient REE-phosphates for further study (we anticipate making detailed analyses of a subset of the most appropriate 25- 30 samples over the two year period). Chemical Petrography: To characterize zoning patterns in xenotime and monazite chemical mapping by two electron microbeam instruments will be carried out. Preliminary mapping of monazite and xenotime inclusions will be done on a FEI Quanta scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a back-scattered electon detector (BSE). This will allow for the rapid location and identification of monazite and xenotime grains as well as an initial view to the internal zoning patterns. Following this initial screening x-ray maps of individual grains will be produced using a Cameca-SX100 electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) equipped with five spectrometers to measure Y Th U La Pb and Nd zoning patterns. Distinguishing between zones of different chemical composition will be crucial for in-situ laser ablation.

The primary goals of this project are to: a) produce publishable digital geologic maps ‚Äì a context map at 1:24000-scale and two inset maps at 1:10000 - with cross- sections and supporting data allowing us to answer important scientific questions in the process and b) to train two graduate students in the making of high-quality geologic maps and conducting field-based geological research. The students will map two independent but complementary areas: Mary Kate Fidler (Ph.D.) will map a 80 km2 area of faulted and tilted volcanic successions in the SW Whipple Mountains and eastern Mopah Range with the goal of understanding the detailed eruptive and faulting history of the shallow levels of the core complex. Beau Gentry (MS) will map a 50 km2 area in the Whipple Mountains that includes an extensive Miocene dike swarm in the footwall of the core complex with the goal of assessing the amount of tilting and intrusive dilation. In addition both students and PI will map the enveloping 200 km2 area at 1:24000 to provide geologic context. Our proposed study area is being actively explored for detachment- hosted gold and rare earth element mineral deposits and this new data will be invaluable to these efforts. The PI will train and mentor the two graduate students during all phases of the project which will primarily involve detailed mapping and field based structural and stratigraphic analysis. The mapping will form the basis for two graduate theses that will also include extensive petrologic 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb geochronologic studies funded by other sources.,2014,2015

The north margin of rapidly-shortening, rapidly-subsiding offshore and onshore Ventura Basin is comprised of major N-dipping faults. These faults extend 200 km between Pt. Conception and the east end of the Santa Susana fault. Vertical motion is partly across a narrow fold scarp in Ventura and the near offshore. This local fold dies out farther offshore and is replaced by broad forelimb tilting. Such tilting implies a continuously variable, but predictable, pattern of subsistence and uplift. Fault representations in the SCEC Community Fault Model (CFM) indicate discontinuities in the shallow faulting that may limit the M<=6.7 for 20th century quakes on this system. M6 1/2 quakes can be disastrous enough, and because they are much more frequent for the same shortening than major quakes, their hazard is high. However, tsunami hazard is much less for a M6.5 than a M7.5 thrust quake, and whether a particular building, bridge, or mountainside will collapse is also affected by the duration of strong ground motion. Does the development of, and shortening across the regional fault system over the last 1 My suggest multiple segment ruptures and major quakes? Multiple grids of 2D industry, USGS, and academic seismic reflection data and eight 3D surveys have recently become publicly available. Nine horizons, precisely dated between 975 ka and 120 ka, have only been integrated with all these data across the central 40 kn of the offshore part of the fault system. A series of published well cross sections will also be incorporated. The existing 3D velocity model from sonic logs and checkshot surveys will be extended to the east and west and to greater depth. Data integration will be accomplished using an industry seismic and well interpretation software. Three dimensional kinematic modeling will include unfolding stratigraphic horizons and reassembling them across faults, and/or trigonometric modeling of tilt and imaged fault 3D attitude vs. slip direction and magnitude, and/or use of volumes in hanging- wall anticlines above footwall basin references. Products from this study will include revised and new 3D representations of fault surfaces and stratigraphic horizons, and new estimates of fault slip rates and slip directions. The digital fault representations will be provided to the SCEC Community Fault Model and to U.S.G.S. researchers, and the digital stratigraphic grids in time and depth will be supplemental data to a publication. Implications include strong ground motion duration and tsunami hazard between 196 Oxnard-Ventura and Santa Barbara-Goleta. Work will also include part of the Pitas Point-North Channel fault system west of Pt. Conception, where it interacts with NNW-striking faults including the southernmost Hosgri fault.",2014,2015

This project combines lidar and field-based investigation of fluvial terraces along the Yakima River with cosmogenic radionuclide geochronology of terrace cover deposits to define spatial and temporal patterns of river downcutting over potentially active structures in the Yakima Fold and Thrust belt (YFTB). The primary question we seek to address is whether incision of the Yakima River reflects differential uplift in response to late-Quaternary growth and development of the Yakima folds. Increasing recognition that reverse faults and folds of the YFTB represent potential earthquake sources underscores the need to resolve the contribution of geologically young deformation to the topographic development of these structures. The Yakima River terraces between Kittitas Valley and Roza Gap represent ideal landforms for reconstructing this history. Intact surfaces and exposed gravel cover deposits suggest a rich archive of sustained fluvial downcutting over three fault-cored anticlinal ridges, Manastash Ridge, Umtanum Ridge, and Selah Butte, from north to south. Preliminary mapping, field reconnaissance, and downstream correlation of terrace remnants reveals multiple generations of surfaces spanning these structures, as well as sufficiently thick cover deposits for 10Be/26Al burial dating of capping gravels based on the isochron method. Specific questions that data collected by this project can address include: 1) whether downcutting of the Yakima River reflects late-Quaternary growth of YTFB anticlines (as expressed by uplifted terraces) occurred in response to recent slip and related uplift on the underlying reverse faults, 2) how spatial and temporal patterns of fluvial incision reveal the locus of surface deformation along the Yakima River, and 3) the relationship among incision and folding of the Yakima River terraces to slip on the underlying reverse faults. Investigation of these topics will shed light on the 161 rate, timing, and magnitude of surface deformation along the Yakima River canyon, and improve our understanding of how contemporary shortening is partitioned among individual structures within the YFTB. Reducing losses from earthquakes. This project will contribute to reducing losses from earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest by characterizing surface deformation and fault activity for structures with an unknown late-Quaternary history of deformation. The YFTB represents a priority target area for understanding earthquake hazards in Washington State due to proximity to critical facilities at the nearby Hanford Nuclear site.",2014,2015

Nor to the best of our knowledge does an integrated data location and access capability exist outside of the Earth sciences for highly distributed heavily populated systems of data products based on voluntary participation. To address this problem we propose integrating the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) the world‚Äôs leading digital library for geospatial and georeferenced information with OPeNDAP. Together these technologies will allow a distributed network of independent information providers to support a single uniform interface for information discovery evaluation verification and retrieval. In addition to addressing a specific problem that exists within the Earth sciences the proposed research will address the more general problem of interpreting the same query according to each of these modalities - digital libraries and content-based access to data - so that a user (human or programmatic) will not have to make any conceptual leaps between them.,2004,2009

With the exception of UC Berkeley’s Consortium of Natural History Museums, CCBER is unique in its multiple roles of 1) curating, under one administrative structure, diverse biological research collections that are integrated into the teaching and research 224 missions of the University of California; 2) directing ecological restoration projects that rely on the collections for biodiversity data; and 3) offering specimen-based K-12 education, scientific workshops, and evening seminars open to the public. Although our vertebrate collections are modest in size, they represent both a thorough synoptic collection for specimen based teaching and strong regional collections for research in evolution, ecology and biogeography. The vertebrate collections have been used for research purposes mostly by students associated with the curators. They are used by academic personnel in several departments both at UCSB and elsewhere for teaching, by the general public for conservation-based education, and for our K-12 environmental education program, Kids in Nature. The herpetology collection (over 13,000 catalogued specimens of amphibians and reptiles) was started in 1977 to serve both research and teaching needs. The UCSB herpetological collections are focused on southwestern California, a region that is significantly underrepresented elsewhere, yet contains the contact areas for most of the state's main zoogeographic regions (i.e., the Coast Ranges, San Joaquin Valley, Sierra Nevada, Mojave Desert, Transverse Ranges, and southern coastal plain). Southwestern California is at the hub of rapid tectonic and regional climate changes that are driving phylogeographic patterning in a majority of the resident species. The collection has had two primary foci. From 1977-1990 the primary emphasis was on collection-building, targeting remote areas, ecotones, relict populations, and areas soon to be alienated as natural habitat. Targeted work was directed at intergrade zones in a number of reptile taxa and isolated habitat areas with unusual species compositions, as well as towards building useful series of hard-to-collect species. Since about 1990 the emphasis has shifted to documentation of the distributions and life histories of regionally declining, threatened, and endangered species. Life history materials, particularly for amphibians, are seldom well represented in western North American collections, and the CCBER collection has strength in this area. Some of the most compelling arguments for federal listing of amphibian and reptile species in southern California have depended on the vouchers and data housed in CCBER, and in the current regulatory environment, these vouchers have been invaluable to state and federal agencies. Herpetological specimens were used in providing some of the biological and distributional data that resulted in the official listing of the California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the Arroyo Toad (Bufo microscaphus californicus) as endangered species by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (see Sweet, 1991 1993, and Jennings 1994). Dr. Sam Sweet regularly uses the collection in his upper division courses at UCSB and to educate agency biologists regarding species of critical concern for this region and for general identification workshops. Most of the specimens are preserved in 70% denatured ethanol, and some in 10% in formaldehyde. The CCBER ornithology collection (6245 catalogued specimens) and mammal collection (1,745 specimens) are important regional collections that will exhibit modest, targeted growth in the future. The collections were started by Drs. Mary Erickson and Barbara DeWolfe, former faculty members in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology (EEMB). The mammal collection includes 172 addition, our website contains images and information on the collections, and the library and archives are used by campus and community members. Our award winning “Kids in Nature” program (received 2007 Governor’s award in Environmental Education) with over 100 5th graders enrolled as well as other K-12 classes visit our museum several times each year and participate in hands-on activities with various collections. The Vertebrate Collection Management Project fulfills several goals in our five-year strategic plan. For the past two years, we have focused on improving collection usage and collection management procedures such as documentation, data accessibility, and preservation of our collections through museum best practices. As part of our strategic plan, in 2008 we asked an external review panel of university 225 faculty from across the country to meet with our faculty curators, our directors and key staff (Goal 8). Their invaluable experience with university natural history collections similar to ours provided us with recommendations in several key areas: improving staffing and storage space for all collections, databasing of all biological specimens and uploading them to appropriate federated databases, and increasing faculty use of the collections campus-wide. We also successfully established a formal curator title on the UCSB campus (a two-year process) that will acknowledge the contributions of the faculty curators during their merit review process and appointed three new adjunct curators and three affiliates to CCBER.",2011,2014

Natural history collections represent the irreplaceable documentation of life on Earth. The Digitization of the UCSB Vascular Plant Collection project will provide UCSB faculty, students, CCBER staff, environmental consultants and the general public with access to these valuable and historically significant collections but also contribute to a larger effort worldwide to digitize millions of biological specimens as quickly and efficiently as possible. The project will also provide the opportunity for student interns to learn new skills and increase their interest in the work to pursue employment or advanced degrees in museum studies or collection management. The Cheadle Center's lack of funding for steady employment of a data entry technician coupled with current data entry protocols indicate a best case scenario of over seven years to complete the databasing of the remaining mounted 57,295 specimens. Our challenge is to make the data available in the most timely way. This will be done by adopting new workflows to capture label data from digital images and using optical character recognition software that can be entered directly into our database, thus reducing keystrokes and improving our hourly rates of data entry. The project goals and activities will be accomplished in one year by hiring an imaging technician who will take digital images of all catalogued sheets and enter specimen data, a project manager who will process images, enter data, and manage image and data uploads into a Specify database, and student interns who will do data entry. In addition, a taxonomist will oversee the curation, mounting, and cataloging of an additional 6200 backlogged specimens and will begin georeferencing completed records. At the end of the project, images and specimen data will be available through a Specify web portal on our web site. Completed California specimen records will also be uploaded to the Consortium of California Herbaria database, while additional specimens that are subsequently georeferenced will also be available to export to additional federated databases, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to be repurposed for use in floras, species lists, and historical distribution studies. The intended results of this project are: 1) improved databasing protocols and increased output leading to completion of the vascular plant collection 2) 71,600 herbarium sheet images available for online identification and assistance in refining loans to relevant specimens 3) 226 increased preservation of specimens by reduced handling over time 4) availability of new data sets for regional and statewide biodiversity studies and 5) increased potential workforce by retaining and educating interns. Additional benefits include improved loan management and tracking and safer long-term backup for images and data. We will evaluate and measure the success of our project through daily statistics, quality checking and modification of protocols as needed to accomplish our goals, monthly review of project activities and progress, and yearly performance evaluations. The Cheadle Center's primary collection management goals are to prepare, organize, and catalog collections for greater accessibility and to make specimen data available online for all of our audiences. This project strengthens our ability to serve our audiences more effectively by supporting these goals and advancing the university's mission of Education, Research, and Outreach.

During the project period our working group convened in person six times. A total of 31 individuals participated in these meetings: 17 based at universities (10 in the United States); five based at aquaria zoological societies or museums (four in the United States); two based at other research organizations (one in the United States); five based at resource agencies in the United States; and two with the Navy. We simplified and increased the generality of a conceptual model developed by the National Research Council (NRC) in 2005 to structure studies of the potential population-level effects of changes in behavior of marine mammals which they called population consequences of acoustic disturbance (PCAD). The NRC committee identified several levels at which anthropogenic sound may affect marine mammals including behavior (e.g. diving resting orientation) life functions (e.g. feeding breeding migrating) vital rates (e.g. adult survival reproduction) and populations (e.g. growth rate structure extirpation). Sound is one of many disturbances that ultimately may affect population dynamics and persistence. The group explicitly recognized that disturbance may have direct and indirect effects on both behavior and physiology. Behavior and physiology in turn may have either direct or indirect effects on population dynamics.,2009,2012

The fundamental product is the fractional snow cover (i.e. the fraction of each pixel covered by snow) and its broadband albedo derived from the grain size and contaminant amount. The main source of unclassified data is MODIS NASA‚Äôs Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer but the methods would apply to any multispectral sensor with wavelength bands in the visible near-infrared and shortwave infrared. The technique we use is spectral unmixing choosing a snow endmember that results in the smallest RMS error. In addition to the snow cover and albedo mapped from a single image we will also develop methods for space-time interpolation when we have a time series of images for example daily MODIS data. Such interpolation is necessary because snow is dynamic changing at a slower time scale than atmospheric phenomena but faster than other surface covers. Sensor noise cloud cover and viewing geometry all affect a single image so a best estimate based on the time series is a more useful product. We use a combination of smoothing splines in the time dimension with q- hull interpolation in the spatial dimension.

This proposal contributes to this effort by investigating the relationships between intraseasonal variations associated with the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) non-MJO variability and air-sea interaction processes that are relevant to the theory of stochastic forcing of ENSO. The proposed research is based on a comprehensive observational analysis and focuses on the influence of intraseasonal oscillations on synoptic-to-intraseasonal anomalies in surface wind stress and heat fluxes their coupled and uncoupled (stochastic) structures. The specific objectives of this proposal are 1) Characterize periods of MJO and non-MJO intraseasonal variations including their interannual variability; 2) Examine the associations between the variability of the MJO and synoptic and intraseasonal variations in surface wind stress and heat fluxes in the tropical Pacific; 3) Determine the relative importance of non-MJO intraseasonal variability on the modulation of surface wind stress and heat fluxes; 4) Investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of coupled and uncoupled (stochastic) components of surface wind stress and heat fluxes.

The close association between BBOP and BATS has led to new discoveries regarding the relationships between optical properties and physical biological and chemical processes in relation to the carbon cycle. The four areas of focus are: 1) continuation of the profile observations of apparent and inherent optical parameters on BATS cruises (including in situ spectroradiometric observations and measurements of CDOM and particulate absorption spectra from bottle samples) 2) the acquisition of near real-time distribution of remotely sensed reflectance spectra and chlorophyll a concentrations 3) in situ data processing database maintenance and distribution and 4) instrument calibration and maintenance of the UCSB ocean optics calibration facility.,2001,2010

An instrumented structure is also monitored to improve our understanding of soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI) effects.

David Siegel Rebecca Lawson,9/1/10,8/31/13,"$90,000 ",National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Federal agencies,NH10AP28H,Phytoplankton Community Composition and Inherent Optical Properties (IOP) in a Complex Coastal Environment,"Ocean color remote sensing has revolutionized our understanding of the global ocean by providing information about primary productivity, biogeochemical cycling and particle size distributions in the surface ocean (Behrenfeld et al., 2005; Kostadinov et al., 2009). Space-borne satellites allow us to remotely sense light reflectance on spatial and temporal scales impossible to achieve by any other means. The remote-sensing reflectance of ocean waters, RRS (), is a function of the absorption and backscattering coefficients of seawater, termed inherent optical properties (IOP’s). IOP’s are in turn an additive function of seawater’s IOP’s (considered constant), and the IOP’s of in-water constituents, such as phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), detrital particulates and suspended sediments. Various empirical and semi-analytical algorithms exist to inversely model these bio-optical properties from ocean reflectance data (e.g., Maritorena et al. 2002). Both the Sea-viewing Wide Field of View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are widely used satellite sensors for measuring ocean reflectance. Standard NASA algorithms (OC4v4 & OC3M) quantifies chlorophyll a concentration from ocean reflectance using an empirical relationship between RRS () and in situ measurements of chlorophyll a (O’Reilly et al., 1998 and updates). This algorithm works well for areas of the open ocean where ocean color is dominated by phytoplankton properties and other constituents are assumed to roughly covary with changes in chlorophyll a (IOCCG, 2000). The Garver-Siegel- Maritorena algorithm (GSM) is a semi-analytical model that quantifies three IOP’s from RRS (): backscattering due to particles, absorption of light due to phytoplankton and absorption of light due to dissolved and detrital organic material (Maritorena et al., 2002; Siegel et al., 2005). Empirical coefficients for the three IOP’s are determined by in situ measurements and held constant in the model based on a global data summary. Recent studies have shown that remote sensing is also a useful too for inversely modeling phytoplankton community structure (e.g., Alvain et al., 2008). Some phytoplankton pigments absorb and/or reflect light with a unique spectral shape. Alvain et al. (2006) was able to explain the variability in chlorophyll a concentrations modeled with the empirical algorithm by the direct relationship of LwN () spectral shape with phytoplankton community composition (Alvain et al, 2004; Alvain et al., 2006). Chemotaxonomic pigment data, used to identify phytoplankton groups or functional types, is becoming increasingly available and this novel approach will boost our understanding about community structure for the global ocean. Coastal areas can be optically complex due to high turbidity, primary productivity and CDOM from deepwater upwelling and/or river inputs and the associated IOP’s may vary independently (IOCCG, 2000). Such areas of optical complexity, termed Case II areas, often require local calibration for empirical coefficients used in remote sensing algorithms such as the GSM. Magnuson et al. (2004) found that locally tuning the GSM Model for the Chesapeake Bay and the Mid-Atlantic Bight resulted in better-calculated chlorophyll a measurements than the global GSM and OC4v4 Models. However, Kostadinov et al. (2007) locally calibrated the GSM Model for the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) and found no improvement in model performance for any of the IOP’s compared with the global version of the GSM Model. The lack of model improvement was attributed to the assumption that spectral shape of the IOP’s is constant in time; therefore the empirical coefficients are held constant. IOP characteristics for the SBC are in fact much more dynamic. Taking a similar approach to that of Alvain et al. (2004), my overarching research 171 question is “How do changes in phytoplankton community structure influence inherent optical properties and thereby ocean color in a complex coastal ocean?”",2010,2013

In all snow products and in remote sensing in general there is a tradeoff between spatial resolution and swath width (and thus frequency of observations). Because most hydrologic applications require regular frequent measurements the instruments that provide the bulk of the data used have been AVHRR and MODIS in the optical part of the spectrum with spatial resolutions of 1.1km and 500m at nadir and the passive microwave sensors with spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers. Because snow- covered area usually varies at a spatial scale finer than that of the resolution of the remote sensing instrument (i.e. the ground instantaneous field-of-view) this subpixel heterogeneity introduces artifacts into the measurements. The sensors usually measure radiation reflected or emitted from a mixture of snow rock soil and vegetation. We contend that the errors introduced by subpixel heterogeneity can be systematic and therefore they are not always eliminated by integrating over many pixels. We propose to develop a new set of products‚Äîsnowcovered area albedo and snow- water equivalence‚Äîthat fuse optical (MODIS AVHRR) and microwave data (SSM/R SSM/I AMSR-E and AMSR) and that incorporate spatial heterogeneity into the analysis. Data product creation and distribution will be provided through a local infrastructure for Earth science product management: a technology suite we call the Earth System Science Server (ES-cubed) an environment for managing the creation maintenance updating and dissemination of Earth science data products. The technology is based on the Microsoft TerraServer and runs on clusters of small computers. In addition to being robust and capacious enough to support public access the infrastructure is flexible enough to manage the idiosyncratic computing ensembles that typify scientific research.,2004,2012

Building on experiences gained through participation in the SIMBIOS project we will merge individual mission determinations of daily level-3 water-leaving radiance in a semi-analytical model and produce a suite of unified ocean color data products. This approach takes advantage of spectral information provided by each satellite sensor and simultaneously produces three distinct science products (chlorophyll and coefficients for colored detrital material absorption and particulate backscatter). This will also account for uncertainty in the input mission data as well as producing uncertainty indices for the merged data products. The data products generated by the merging procedure will be validated against in situ data and by comparisons with single mission products. Science applications of the merged products will also serve to validate these new merged products and to demonstrate their utility. All aspects of model development data sets comparison and validation will be documented and available to NASA/GSFC for implementation and the production of merged products for the complete EOS/NPP era. UCSB will interact and work with the GSFC group on merged products comparisons and the identification and fixing of incompatibilities between merged products from different approaches.

However, the prospects are much more deficient: currently existing satellite systems do not offer methods to estimate snow water equivalence (density depth) or snow wetness over the range of Earth’s environments. The proposed study will identify the suitable microwave sensor parameters and develop the corresponding quantitative retrieval algorithms for monitoring spatial and temporal distributions of snow water equivalence and snow wetness of the seasonal snow cover on land. The components of this investigation are: (1) completion of the database simulation for the algorithm development under the sensor configurations identified by NASA Cold Land Processes Working Group; (2) development of a physically-based algorithm to estimate snow water equivalence from dual-frequency and dual-polarization radar measurements; (3) development of a physically-based algorithm to estimate snow wetness with dual- frequency radar measurements; (4) development of a combined (active/passive) physically-based algorithm to estimate snow water equivalence using dual-polarization Ku-band radar and dual-frequency radiometer measurements.

Through a partnership with Terra Image USA, UC Santa Barbara has the unique opportunity to access multiple dates of imagery of the Santa Barbara Channel from May of 2004 to the present.

UVR photolysis of CDOM drives the global ocean surface distribution of CDOM seen from satellite.

I propose experimental determinations of apparent quantum yield of CDOM photolysis on open-ocean samples and immediate application of these measurements to global CDOM data derived from NASA ocean color.

Kelp forests have great economic value and are harvested for use in products ranging from pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to food products and aquaculture feed. Perhaps more importantly, giant kelp is an “ecosystem engineer” providing both food and habitat to a diverse array of biologically and commercially important species of algae, invertebrates, fish, and marine mammals while exporting large quantities of organic matter to adjacent littoral and continental shelf ecosystems. Economic analyses show California kelp forests create at least $250 million in revenue each year. Here, we propose to develop a predictive understanding of giant kelp forests in the nearshore waters of California using a combination of remote sensing, numerical modeling and the analysis of available field data. We will take advantage of high resolution, multi-spectral SPOT imagery to map kelp cover dynamics on spatial scales of >10 m and monthly time scales. We will develop new measures of kelp productivity and kelp canopy condition that can be assayed using available remote sensing imagery as well as to guide future mission planning. We will examine the role of disturbance and other environmental factors such as surface wave stress (using regional wave models), coastal currents (using HF radar remote sensing), sediment plumes (using MODIS & SeaWiFS ocean color imagery) and nutrient availability (using field and remote sensing proxies) on our high resolution observations of kelp canopy cover.

Each PnB cruise is made up of seven oceanographic stations (Figure 1), all taken on one day. At each station, a variety of optical, physical, biological, chemical and geological oceanographic parameters are 173 sampled (Table 1). All sampling protocols and analysis methods have been consistently applied and are consistent with those recommended by the SeaWiFS, SIMBIOS and JGOFS programs (e.g., Knap et al. 1993; Mueller and Austin, 1995; Fargion and Mueller, 2000). Documentation for PnB field procedures is available at www.icess.ucsb.edu/PnB/MethodsManual.html. Determinations of water leaving radiance spectra LwN(l) are the key ingredient in any ocean color field effort. Estimates of LwN(l) will be determined by analysis of spectroradiometry profiles (a BSI PRR-2600 system). We have published an intercomparison analysis using PnB data which indicates that determinations of LwN(l) are best made using determinations of the upwelling radiance leaving the ocean and measurements of incident irradiance (Toole et al. 2000). In addition, vertical profiles of diffuse attenuation coefficient spectra, Kd(z,l), are measured. All radiometric measurements are calibrated at UCSB against NIST traceable standards (O’Brien et al. 2000). The UCSB facility has participated in all SIRREX and SIMBIOS calibration studies (O’Brien et al. 2000; simbios.gsfc.nasa.gov/RoundRobin/). At each station, discrete water samples will be collected for surface waters using our SeaBird CTD/rosette sampler (12 5-liter Niskin bottles). Analyses will be made for chlorophyll a (Turner fluorometry), inorganic nutrient (SiO4, NO3, NO2 & PO4; UCSB analytical lab), particulate organic material (POC & PON; UCSB analytical lab), dissolved organic material (DOC & DON; Craig Carlson’s lab - UCSB) and lithogenic and biogenic particulate silica (Mark Brzezinski’s lab - UCSB) concentrations. The POC/PON and DOC/DON sampling is new for PnB and we started collected samples for analysis in January of this year. Samples will also be taken for phytoplankton pigment concentrations. Spectrophotometric analysis of absorption coefficients for colored dissolved organic material, particulate detritus and phytoplankton (analyzed by our group). We find that use of the Mitchell [1990] beta correction results in the overestimate of aph(675) by as much as 70%. We have conducted several experiments to produce a beta correction algorithm for PnB which produce much more reasonable results (Guillocheau, 2003). At PnB station 4 (the SB Channel center), profiles of most discrete determinations are made at 6 depths over the upper 75 m. This results in 13 discrete samples per PnB cruise. Hydrographic parameters are available from the CTD for analyses of water mass variability (Siegel et al., 2006a). A suite of inherent optical property (IOP) instrumentation is also deployed with the CTD/rosette system (WETLabs AC9 and HOBI Labs Hydroscat-6). This enables us to determine in situ profiles of spectral absorption, a(z,l), beam attenuation, c(z,l), total scattering b(z,l) and backscattering, bb(z,l), coefficients. Clear water calibrations are done for the AC9 instrumentation before each cruise using a Mille-Q clean water system dedicated for this task. Uncertainties in our clear water calibrations are typically within 0.015 m-1 which is more than a order of magnitude smaller than the signals that we sample. Further, we calibrate the backscatter meter before each cruise using a calibration fixture of HOBI Labs' design.

This has led to the adoption of ecosystem-based management (EBM) methods (White et al, 2008, Botsford et al, 2003, Halpern & Warner, 2002). The work that I am proposing will improve our ability to predict a fundamental aspect of EBM: larval connectivity (Kinlan & Gaines, 2003). For many important, nearshore, fished stocks population connectivity, mediated by larval dispersal, is a fundamental driving force behind population dynamics. My work aims to predict larval connectivity. I will develop an inter- disciplinary model that integrates numerical ocean simulations with NASA data products. This model will focus, in a spatially explicit manner, on the two dominant forms of larval mortality: • Abiotic mortality due to advection, by ocean currents, away from suitable habitat. • In-flight biotic mortality, due to predation and starvation, along the larval dispersal trajectory. By considering both the abiotic and biotic forms of larval mortality my work will describe larval connectivity in unprecedented detail. I propose to: • Develop simulations of larval dispersal, using the results of existing high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the waters off Southern California. This will generate estimates of abiotic larval mortality. • Use satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl) data products to quantify the in-flight nutritional experience of dispersing larvae. • Investigate the relationship between in-flight larval mortality and SST and Chl experience. I will do this for a number of exemplar species whose life history describe a range of survival abilities. • Use an existing stock-harvest model to explore the economic consequences of abiotic and in- flight biotic mortality. This work will take the Southern California Bight (SoCal Bight) as a test bed. We will develop Lagrangian particle advection simulations of larval dispersal, representing the cutting edge in our ability to predict patterns of larvae dispersal, and by integrating information generated from several NASA assets (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor/SeaWiFS, MODIS/AQUA and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/AVHRR), we will, for the first time, generate estimates of both the abiotic loss of larvae and the in-flight biotic loss of larvae. This will allow us to make estimates of population connectivity at an unprecedented level of temporal and spatial detail.",2008,2011

Present-day numerical models used to simulate global ocean biogeochemical cycles parameterize both the function and the size of components of the plankton community. However, there is still precious little observational data to validate the results of these model simulations of plankton community structure and their biogeochemical impacts. In recent years, new capabilities have been developed to assess phytoplankton community structure and organic carbon cycling from satellite ocean color observations. However, validation of these novel remote sensing retrieval approaches and their further development is limited by scarcity of field observations over the variety of biogeochemical provinces of the global ocean. Since 2003, we have been studying the distribution and dynamics and implications of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the global ocean ""piggybacking"" on hydrographic sections of the CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Project. With NASA support, we have collected and analyzed radiometric profiles, particle and CDOM absorption spectra, and surface phytoplankton pigment (HPLC and fluorometric chlorophyll a) data. To date we have collected a broad and diverse data set from the North and Equatorial Atlantic, North and South Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins with some lines continuing through the Southern Ocean to the Antarctic. Our major science achievement to date resulted in a new understanding of the relative roles of biogeochemical vs. ventilation on subsurface CDOM distributions. This work also has provided considerable validation data in poorly sampled areas of the ocean. 144 Here, we propose to continue this effort on upcoming CO2/CLIVAR sections in the Arabian Sea, South Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and North Atlantic, and to further enhance the program by adding a newly constructed flow-through system that will also measure surface inherent optical properties (IOPs) such as spectral absorption, backscattering and particle size spectra (and chlorophyll and CDOM fluorescence), in whole water and 0.2 micron filtered water. Our field effort will be closely coupled to our ongoing collaborative efforts in developing new ocean color products useful for assessing global productivity and carbon cycling. The combination of field and satellite data analyses will enable us to understand the controls on plankton community structure allowing an understanding of the processes by which phytoplankton community structure affects open ocean IOPs and how one can best assess community structure characteristics from IOPs.",2009,2014

The interpolation scheme has potential for operating in real time for seasonal runoff forecasting to inform decision-making. With 25 years of snow-covered area data the interpolation scheme can be used to examine peak SWE in Sierra Nevada River basins to investigate natural variability and trends. The approach examines patterns from estimates of the spatial distribution of snow from a retrospective energy balance method and thereby incorporates hypsometric and land cover characteristics of snow in the Sierra Nevada. The objective is a better understanding of hydrologic sensitivity and land-atmosphere coupling through space-based remote sensing and distributed basin modeling. The overarching science objective is the development of an interpolation method to integrate satellite and in situ observations to produce real time estimates of spatially distributed SWE that can be used for runoff forecasting. The investigation addresses the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) research objective to improve our capability to predict extreme events such as floods caused by rain on snow. I will use spectral mixing analysis to quantify fractional snow- covered area (fSCA) and an energy balance model to quantify SWE two key variables in the energy and water cycles that represent another SMD research objective. Finally I will address SMD research objectives by developing historical fSCA and SWE datasets that can be used in climate simulations for predictability of water carbon and nitrogen.,2009,2012

The role that bedrock-channel incision plays in the evolution of tectonically active mountain belts has become a central topic in tectonic- geomorphology over the last two decades and has lead to the development of the stream power law which directly links erosional efficacy per unit area of the channel bed to discharge slope specific weight of water and channel-width. Previous studies have relied on simple power-law scalings to estimate channel-widths based on discharge while more sophisticated techniques have recently been proposed that are based on regionally limited data and/or contain fundamental underlying assumptions that preclude their ubiquitous application. Our research improves on previous studies of channel width scalings in orogenic systems by calibrating spatially ubiquitous ASTER imagery with higher resolution Google Earth imagery (GeoEye-1 and SPOT) and field surveys to yield reliable sub-pixel mixing models for application to width-extraction algorithms for the Himalaya. These channel widths will then be combined with ASTER GDEM topography (slopes) TRMM precipitation data (discharge) and MODIS imagery (snowcover and evapotranspiration values) into a specific stream power analysis (proxy for erosion) for the Himalaya.

John Melack Laura Hess Sally MacIntyre,1/1/10,12/31/14,"$357,736 ",National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Federal agencies,NNX10AB66G,Analysis and Synthesis of Carbon Dynamics on Amazon Floodplains,Our research on the ecology hydrology and biogeochemistry of Amazon wetlands under the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA-ECO) addressed important aspects of the regional carbon dynamics of the Amazon basin combining remote sensing and field measurements to calculate evasion of methane and carbon dioxide from rivers and wetlands. Our proposed work synthesizes newly available remote sensing datasets and analyses recently completed field measurements and recent modeling advances with past results in order to target important remaining uncertainties regarding carbon dioxide and methane dynamics on Amazonian floodplains. This work will contribute to understanding of tropical riverine and wetland systems in the global context of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dynamics. Furthermore recent studies have indicated that lakes and wetlands make a significant contribution to the global carbon budget because of the high rates of carbon uptake and metabolism in these systems. Therefore our research in the large and productive Amazon basin is likely to be quantitatively important globally. About 20% of the Amazon basin is seasonally inundated and these wetlands are sites of intense biological activity that can have a strong influence on the regional carbon dynamics. Understanding the effects of these dynamics on air-water exchanges of CO2 and CH4 is of critical importance if we are to estimate the net contribution of Amazon wetlands to greenhouse gas emissions. To quantify this influence it is necessary to improve estimates of the fluxes and balance of carbon incorporating the principal sources of spatial and temporal variability and developing numerical models to simulate and integrate their effects. Hence we propose to study the organic carbon dynamics and its influence on the net emissions of CO2 and CH4 on central Amazon floodplains. We propose to examine three unresolved issues: 1. The role of aquatic herbaceous macrophytes and litterfall from flooded forests as sources of organic carbon fueling the outgassing of carbon dioxide and methane from wetlands and rivers. 2. The regional seasonal and interannual variations in evasion of methane and carbon dioxide. 3. The inundation dynamics of floodplains on multiple scales and their function as a physical template for biogeochemical processes. To resolve these issues and to advance predictive capability and understanding of how the carbon balance of Amazon floodplains will respond to environmental changes requires several coordinated activities. Hydrological and hydrodynamic models will be integrated with biogeochemical analyses and models and with remotely sensed-based estimates of plant growth and phenology.,2010,2014

New applications for ocean color (algorithms, etc) will require novel and enhanced existing measurements of radiometric and inherent optical properties. This project will apply and test against field data, prospective algorithms addressing aspects of community structure and carbon flux, taking advantage of our time-series data records and ongoing related research at the site. We intend to introduce and test evolutionary improvements to techniques for measuring radiometric optical properties at the site. In particular the beginning part of the project will include development of an autonomous free-floating profiling optical buoy system (the Near-Surface Profiling Buoy, NSPB). The NSPB is a flexible, easily deployed, and is a cost-effective alternative to long-term, moored optical buoy installations. The NSPB eliminates the need to address biofouling and extrapolation to the sea surface from discrete fixed depths, which complicate data analysis from long-term moored optical buoy data. This approach also avoids modeling of upwelling radiance from the reflected sky radiance, which bedevils above- water approaches. We believe a global network of short-term, autonomous profile systems, patterned after the system proposed here, would change how ocean color satellite vicarious calibration is performed. The NSPB system will also make direct and diffuse incident irradiance determinations which will be useful for assessing aerosol and cloud optical properties and incident spectral irradiance at the sea surface.

However, our ability to remotely assess carbon export rates globally remains primitive at best as carbon export is most commonly estimated as the product of remotely sensed values of net primary production (NPP) multiplied by a very simple export-ratio model. These models may provide a reasonable assessment of present state of mean carbon export, but they will not assess changes in export as these are purely empirical models and none of the critical information about mechanisms driving export are included. To make that next step towards a mechanistic assessment of ocean carbon flux we need knowledge of upper ocean particle source material concentrations and characteristics and knowledge of how physical oceanographic processes alter upper ocean particle fields and package suspended materials into sinking particles that are exported into the ocean interior. Here we propose a coupled field, imagery analysis and modeling program aimed at understanding the mechanisms driving carbon export and developing novel tools for its remote assessment. Specifically, we will conduct two ~3200 km long meridional transects across the North Atlantic (~40 to 20oN) collaborating with the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS). We will sample carbon export (via 234Th disequilibria) from vertical water samples and surface samples from underway collection (with 10 km spatial resolution). Concentrations of the radioisotope thorium-234 are an excellent index for euphotic zone particle removal as measured by its disequilibrium with its parent (238U) and recent technical advances enable its high spatial resolution sampling from a ship’s underway flow system. Upper ocean particle concentrations and characteristics will be sampled by measuring inherent optical properties, phytoplankton abundances and pigments, size-fractionated inherent optical property and chlorophyll concentrations, particulate organic carbon, transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) concentrations, and the particle size distribution (PSD) spectrum. These observations will be made both underway from the ship’s surface underway system and as vertical profiles. This work will constrain the types and concentrations of particles and processes that are leading to particle export. Satellite ocean color observations of inherent optical properties and the PSD will be integrated into the interpretation of the field observations. A key element of our proposal is the simultaneous observations of particle export and source material characteristics and the physical drivers of particle aggregation. Recent modeling studies have shown that Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) can be determined from merged satellite altimetry observations. LCSs define the attracting and repelling surfaces in 2-D flow fields and provide an excellent, diagnostic tool for 176 assessing regions where submesoscale particle aggregation will occur as well as vertical motions at fronts. The relationships among LCS locations and intensities will be evaluated using observations from the ship transects and from advance ocean color data products. The proposed combination of high-resolution field observations, remote sensing data analysis and assessment of LCSs is a unique feature of our work.",2011,2014

Major refinements include 1) using yearly or seasonal averaged surface emissivities from C6 MODIS LST products as initial values in the day/night algorithm; 2) using multi-day Terra and Aqua MODIS data in a BRDF scheme for retrieving stable BRDF parameters in bands 20, 22 and 23 so that the angular variation in surface emissivities in all bands may be well modeled; 3) refining the MODIS cloudmask product collaboratively with the 228 cloudmask group to fix the discontinuity problem in LSTs along latitude of ±60o.

This is a tall order and a science working group led by Chuck McClain (NASA/GSFC) has been focused on setting mission requirements. One area where the ocean science working group has been having difficulties is for Ocean Productivity and Carbon Cycle (OPCC) parameters beyond NPP.

The first and main study would look into the potential benefits of the UV bands to better discriminate between CDOM and phytoplankton light absorption. Currently, ocean color products are derived from bio-optical algorithms and models that use reflectance data from wavebands in the visible. Sub-surface chlorophyll- concentration (CHL) and the combined absorption of colored dissolved organic matter and detritic matter (CDM) are two typical products derived from ocean color data but it is often difficult to separate and accurately quantify them as both are strong absorbers at short visible wavelengths (typically 412 and 443 nm in ocean color sensors). The UV domain may offer the possibility to better discriminate between CHL and CDM as differences in their light absorption characteristics may be more pronounced in the UV. While CDM absorption in the UV is relatively well documented, there are much more uncertainties and variability in phytoplankton UV absorption. We thus propose to analyze in situ CDM and CHL absorption measurements that include UV bands from the largest and most diverse possible data set we will assemble from our own field campaigns (e.g. CLIVAR, BBOP, Plumes & Blooms), the NOMAD data set and the SeaBASS archive. We will then determine the optimal parameterization for the CHL and CDM absorption terms in the UV in our semi- analytical ocean color model (GSM) and conduct tests to assess the benefits and usefulness of these bands to accurately retrieve the CDM and CHL components during the inversion of spectral reflectance data similar to what the ACE ocean radiometer will provide.",2011,2012

Snowmelt runoff forecasting in mountainous areas such as the western United States has developed as empirical models forced by sparse in situ measurements of snow water equivalent that lie primarily in subalpine regions. Not only do the seasonal forecast models already have large errors in some years they rely on a data record that assumes stationarity and therefore are theoretically ill suited for water manage- ment in a changing climate. Moreover they are unable to accurately address water resources during extreme events such as persisting spring snow or new snowfall in the alpine zone above almost all measurement sites. In response to this need for better assessment of the snow resource in mountain areas new Earth System Data Records that use MODIS data have become available. However they have not been rigorously validated and uncertainties and the possible presence of systematic error are not known. In this investigation we propose to undertake this necessary validation through four years because the products will evolve. The specific Earth System Data Records are: Daily MODIS fractional snow cover. MODIS fractional snow cover based on the normalized difference snow index originally developed for Landsat [Dozier 1989; Hall et al. 2006] available from Terra (product MOD10A1) since 2000 and from Aqua (product MYD10A1) since 2002 [Salomonson and Appel 2004 2006]. MODIS fractional snow cover based on spectral mixing [Painter et al. 2009] available for the Sierra Nevada since 2000 but produced on demand for any MODIS scene. The al- gorithm will be used for the NOAA/NOHRSC National Snow Model starting in water year 2010-11 and has been adopted for the GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sched- uled for launch in the 2015 timeframe. Snow albedo of the fractional snow cover based on choosing the snow endmember from spectral mixing that minimizes the residual error [Painter et al. 2009]. A snow albedo prod- uct is also available for the normal ‚Äúbinary‚Äù (snow vs no-snow) snow-covered area product [Klein and Stroeve 2002] but it is usually applied to continuous snow cover. MODIS fractional snow cover and albedo smoothed and interpolated across time and space to compensate for cloud cover off-nadir viewing and data dropouts [Dozier et al. 2008]. The analyses are available as monthly data cubes during the snow seasons for the Sierra Nevada since 2000. The coupling presented here of fractional snow cover and the albedo of that snow provides water managers with spatially and temporally dense data records that populate modeling in- puts for forecasting and research. Their use in snowmelt models and reservoir operations would be advanced by our proposed investigation which would validate the products analyze the structure of errors and advise users of caveats and likely accuracy. Of greatest interest is their potential combination with surface data and energy balance models to help estimate the -1-spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). SWE can be interpolated in near real time from snow pillow and snow course measurements constraining the surface measurements by satellite snow-cover estimates [Fassnacht et al. 2003]. In addition SWE can be reconstructed from satellite snow-cover estimates and snow-depletion models [Martinec and Rango 1981; Cline et al. 1998; Molotch 2009].,2011,2015

These highly seasonal glacial meltwaters have immediate consequences for the water food and power supplies of densely populated regions in adjacent countries including Peru and Bolivia. In the central Andes glacial mass- balance studies are extremely rare and both spatially and temporally limited. While glacial inventories exist in this region they are incomplete and the databases do not contain crucial parameters such as debris coverage a parameter increasingly gaining attention in predicting and understanding glacial mass balance changes. As a result quantifying the extent of the disequilibrium of these central Andean tropical glaciers remains a challenge and observation and understanding of these terrestrial water stores and fluxes remains poorly constrained despite their importance for downstream populations. Glacial dynamics are not uniform throughout the central Andes. However the degree to which varying parameters affect glacial volumetric changes has not been systematically investigated for the tropical glaciers of Peru and Bolivia. For example large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (e.g. ENSO) are known to be a dominant forcing factor determining glacial advance and retreat in this region yet this impact has not been consistently quantified. This study will use Digital Elevation Models produced from Corona (~1970s) and ASTER (2000-2010) stereo pairs and the SRTM (2000) to quantify volumetric changes. Additionally areal changes and debris coverage will be analyzed with Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER imagery in combination with glacial surface velocities derived from image cross-correlation techniques. This four-decade long timeseries will be used to investigate the spatial variability of central Andean glacial dynamics in relation to glacial debris cover topographic (e.g. elevation relief channel slope) and climatic (seasonality and impact of ENSO) factors.

Wind relaxation events, plumes and blooms are some of the mechanisms responsible for the mixing and transport of organic and inorganic materials such as larvae, nutrients, pollutants and sediments along the continental shelf. In the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC), California, these mechanisms cause dramatic changes in the color of the ocean on time scales of days to weeks. The variability of ocean color on short timescales has not been well characterized or accounted for by satellite remote sensing due to revisit time and sampling issues, which makes such observations impossible. Moreover, many ocean processes tend to develop under overcast conditions, when no imagery or in situ data is being collected, biasing the assessment of those systems to clear sky conditions. Underestimation of ocean productivity is also expected because phytoplankton pigmentation adapts to changes in light availability, and we might be biasing satellite observations of phytoplankton biomass to high light, clear sky conditions. My research objective is to characterize the variability of bio-optical properties on time scales of days to weeks in the Santa Barbara Channel and account for the observations that have been missed by satellite systems due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. An electric glider will be used to make repeated bio-optical and physical measurements of the water column during plumes, blooms and relaxation events at excellent temporal and spatial resolutions, nearly independent of weather conditions. An extensive set of in situ data will be synthesized and used to complement NASA satellite ocean color data. The characterization of ocean color variability in the SBC in finer time scale will provide new insights about how the ocean responds to physical disturbances, what are the ecological implications of rapid changes in bio-optical properties of the water, and how the current under sampling influences how much we know about coastal marine ecosystems and primary productivity.

To judge feasibility the proposed effort looks at two regions a validation case and a case representing the characteristics outlined above. For the validation case we propose to use the Sierra Nevada of California a mountain range of extensive historical study emerging scientific innovation and conflicting priorities in managing water for agriculture urban areas hydropower recreation habitat and flood control. For the austere regional focus we will examine southwest and south Asia where some of the most persistent drought in the world causes food insecurity and combines with political instability and occasional flooding to affect US national security. Our approach will use a mix of satellite data and a spare modeling approach to present information essential for planning and decision making ranging from optimization of proposed infrastructure projects to assessment of water resources stored as snow for seasonal forecasts. We will combine optical imagery (MODIS on Terra/Aqua VIIRS on NPP) passive microwave data (SSM/I AMSR-E) retrospective reconstruction with energy balance calculations and gridded feed-forward uncoupled land surface modeling to establish retrospective context. Specifically we will use the period spanning the decade-long record from Terra and Aqua to bracket the historical record. In the California Sierra Nevada surface measurements have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for us to validate our approach which we will extend to the Hindu Kush of High Asia where surface data are sparse and where access presents significant difficulties. The world's mountains accumulate substantial snow and in some areas produce the bulk of the runoff. In ranges like Afghanistan's Hindu Kush availability of water resources affects US policy martial and humanitarian operations and national security. The rugged terrain makes surface measurements difficult and also affects the analysis of remotely sensed data. The analysis would leverage several techniques developed from NASA-sponsored research and use NASA instruments. While using data from the Sierra Nevada for validation the activity would also improve water resource assessment in that region where statistically based forecasts occasionally produce significantly errors.

Recent studies using Landsat multispectral imagery have successfully assessed changes in kelp biomass at temporal and spatial scales once deemed infeasible. This proposed study would extend this work and use hyperspectral images (AVIRIS) of giant kelp forests in the Santa Barbara Channel to determine the age structure and condition of kelp fronds and relate changes in frond demographics to physical and environmental variables already measured by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) project at UCSB. Measurable differences in the in vivo reflectance spectra of giant kelp fronds at different life stages have been confirmed by earlier studies. Giant kelp blades of known age will be collected once per month and photosynthetic characteristics will be measured in the laboratory through the use of oxygen evolution and fluorescence spectroscopy. The proposed project will help assess how the impacts of a changing environment impact nearshore nutrient cycling and biodiversity. AVIRIS images of SBC LTER kelp forests from 1997 to present are available for our use. We are in possession of all equipment to be used for analysis of giant kelp in vivo reflectance spectra and photosynthetic characteristics and are in a position to immediately begin work.

The determination of EP and NCP on regional to global space scales and seasonal to interannual time scales is central for the rationale for NASA’s up-coming Pre-Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (PACE) mission. However, our ability to assess these important carbon cycle parameters from satellite data remains quite limited and new approaches and data sets are desperately needed. We propose the development of a major field campaign focused on a process level description of NCP and EP to provide progress toward the prediction of important carbon cycle parameters on local to global scales. This field campaign we have coined (for now) as: “Controls on Open Ocean Productivity and EXport – COOPEX”. The overarching question for COOPEX is How 179 do upper ocean processes control net community production and carbon export in the open ocean and the sequestration of exported carbon to depth? A major field campaign focused on controls of carbon cycling parameters is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms controlling NCP and EP in the open ocean and provide the necessary data and models to assess changes in these parameters that can be measured by satellite observations. There are many recent technical advances in remote sensing science, ocean biogeochemistry, bio-optics, autonomous sampling platforms and coupled physical-ecological-biogeochemical numerical modeling that make this vision a possibility – and one that needs to be accomplished now. Here, we request support from the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry program to develop an implementation plan for COOPEX. Funds are requested for a small scoping workshop of domain experts (~25) to be held at UC Santa Barbara to scope and formulate the COOPEX implementation plan. The scoping workshop and the implementation plan writing will be led by Dave Siegel (UCSB) and Ken Buesseler (WHOI). Assisting them is a team of domain experts that will help steer the project forward and will assist in the writing of the implementation plan.",2012,2014

First, merged products offer improved coverage of the ocean at daily to monthly time scales, which reduces the uncertainties in estimates derived from those products for both local and global studies. Second, merged data products often have lower uncertainties than the same product from any single sensor. Last, data merging has also proven a powerful tool to identify inconsistencies among the different data sources or issues with the sensors’ radiometry. In all, data merging benefits both the ocean color and biogeochemistry science that uses its data and the inter-sensors calibration/validation activities. Here, we propose to continue the development of unified and coherent ocean color time series through the merging of data from multiple sensors. We will continue the development of merged ocean color products from the GSM semi-analytical model. This model merges data at the Remote sensing reflectance level and derives several biogeochemically relevant data products simultaneously along with uncertainty estimates at each pixel. In addition, we will also generate merged products from higher level data (e.g. chlorophyll- a concentration) as such products are no longer available to the science community. We will also develop new merged ocean color products. In particular, we will develop a merged remote sensing reflectance product that will allow users to work with a data set with improved spectral resolution and lower uncertainties. Last, uncertainty estimates for all merged products will be generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis. All products and uncertainty estimates will be validated through matchup analyses. The merged records will cover the time span over which multiple ocean color sensors are or will be available (SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS, VIIRS, OLCI,...).

Dynamical consequences of these phenomena include perturbation of the chemical and biological environment that can dramatically impact biogeochemical cycling in the ocean. The processes that regulate this response are extraordinarily complex, challenging us to understand how the physical, biological and chemical processes are functionally related. Recent evidence suggests that mesoscale eddies are an important nutrient transport mechanism in the oligotrophic waters of the main subtropical gyres. Numerical simulations and satellite based statistical estimates indicate that the magnitude of the eddy-driven nutrient flux could be sufficient to balance geochemical estimates of new production, which far exceed that which can be sustained by traditional mechanisms of nutrient supply. Relatively few direct observations of this process are available, owing to the spatial and temporal intermittency of the events which drive it. Available data demonstrate that isopycnal displacements associated with certain types of eddies can transport nutrients into the euphotic zone, resulting in the accumulation of chlorophyll 182 in the overlying waters. However, the nature of the biological response and its impact on coupled biogeochemical cycles and export has yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, the relationship between eddy-induced upwelling and diapycnal mixing in and below the mixed layer remains obscure; the strength of this interaction determines the degree to which the eddy-driven effects are irreversible and thereby effect a net biogeochemical flux. Our team of investigators proposes to collect a set of measurements that will document phytoplankton physiological response, changes in community structure, export and the biogeochemical ramifications of eddy induced upwelling and mixing in the Sargasso Sea. Target features will be identified prior to field deployment via remote sensing. High resolution surveys will be undertaken with an undulating towed instrument that includes a Video Plankton Recorder and a Fast Repetition Rate Fluorometer. This suite of instruments will facilitate simultaneous assessment of photosynthetic parameters and the species assemblage of phytoplankton and zooplankton. These measurements will be accompanied by discrete water sampling of biogeochemical properties in sets of stations along cross sections of the chosen features. Export will be measured at selected locations within the mesoscale structure. Rates of mixing between the surface mixed layer (order 10m) and waters at the base of the euphotic zone (order 100m) will be inferred from the Helium flux gauge and measured directly with an SF6 tracer release. Taken together, these observations will be sufficient to test the hypothesis that eddy-induced upwelling increases photosynthetic rates, changes community structure and increases export from the euphotic zone, thereby playing an important role in biogeochemical cycling of the subtropical oceans. In essence, what is suggested herein is a mechanism by which a highly nonlinear biological response regulates the impact of a physical disturbance on biogeochemical cycling. We plan to incorporate what we learn about the nature of this regulation into basin-scale eddy-resolving models of the North Atlantic in order to investigate the impacts of this coupled physical/biological/chemical dynamic on large-scale biogeochemical distributions. We hypothesize that geophysical turbulence causes a net acceleration of elemental cycling that plays a fundamental role in maintaining the mean biogeochemical state of the ocean. The proposed research is to be carried out in a collaborative effort amongst ten principal investigators from five institutions: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Rutgers University, University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Miami.

Along the U.S. West Coast, nearly all waters deeper than 20 fathoms (~36 m) are closed to all bottom fishing to protect several species of rockfish from local extinction. Similar, though actually unrelated, management actions have created no-take marine reserves around the northern Channel Islands as a means of protecting biodiversity and fish abundances. The phrase ""the oceans are in crisis"" once used only by is now being used with increasing regularity by fishery managers and fishers themselves. The decline of fisheries and ecological diversity of nearshore waters is driving the ""crisis-mode"" nature by which nearshore fish resources are presently being managed. Clearly, it is time to examine the complexity of nearshore communities and the fisheries that depend upon 183 them. Nearshore fisheries couple natural (ecological) and human (fishery management) processes resulting in an emergent dynamic system, rich in complexity. The goal of this proposal is to develop a process-level description of nearshore fisheries and their management patterned after California coastal environments. Specifically, we propose to examine the emergent complexity that arises due to interactions among chaotic coastal circulations, fished organism life cycles, the productivity and suitability of nearshore habitats, the intensity and nature of fish harvesting, the economics governing fisheries, fishers and fishery regulations and the bureaucratic system which implements regulations. Our aim is to assess the balance points among costs, profits, uncertainties, stock viability and ecological values of nearshore fished environments. Central to developing a predictive understanding of the interactions between flow, fish and fishing (F3) is the notion of time/space scales. The physics, biology, and socio-economic processes governing this coupled natural/human system operate on inherently different spatial and temporal scales. Without considering the mismatch in scales explicitly, mismanagement of fisheries is likely to continue unabated. Fortunately, the components of a solution to this problem are at hand. Recent advances in modeling coastal ocean circulations, marine life cycle dynamics, the values of information to fishery management, and the consequences of management choices in the face of uncertainty have independently created the pieces necessary to assemble a synthetic approach to nearshore fisheries management. Moreover, large-scale programs monitoring the dynamics of coastal ecosystems are finally providing the empirical data necessary to parameterize and test these models. The individual investigators in this project are leaders in these component efforts. Collectively, they will link these components into new computational and conceptual models that examine optimal management choices in the face of unavoidable physical and biological uncertainty. Although this project uses the Southern California Bight as a focal ecosystem, the issues addressed and conceptual frameworks that arise will have broader, global impacts. Declines in fish stocks and yields are not restricted to any nation or biogeographical region. Indeed, the core problems from mismatches in spatial and temporal scales are characteristic of nearly all marine fisheries. In addition, although fisheries management commonly stops at political borders, ocean flows and fish do not. The ecological scales of coastal ecosystems are inherently international in scope. The international partnerships between this proposed effort and ongoing ecological programs in Mexico, Chile, New Zealand and Australia will expand the regional focus of this effort to global dimensions. Finally, this project links efforts by physical, natural and social scientists in a system where understanding all three components and, more importantly, their interactions are critical to success. The interdisciplinarity of the effort is not just buzzword. Approaches that do not link across these disciplines are doomed to fail. Hence, this project has rich educational opportunities across a range of ages. Since most have at one time been a part of a fishery, either as a harvester or a consumer, the key issues should be appreciated at their core by nearly everyone. This program integrates several opportunities for interdisciplinary education from K-12, through undergraduate, graduate and adult programs.",2003,2009

Circulation observations for the coastal ocean exist primarily in the form of time-averaged Eulerian fields. Many applied problems in coastal oceanography are concerned 150 with how things are transported and where they go. Accurate Lagrangian stochastic transport models for the near-shore region are a necessary link between the copious Eulerian coastal circulation data from high frequency (HF) radar systems, and transport information required by coastal resource managers tasked with identifying the fate of pollutants, larvae, and objects lost- at-sea. Specific research objectives are to: 1. Observe surface flow fields in two coastal regions using HF radar and high-resolution drifters; 2. Develop accurate Lagrangian transport models to predict trajectories from the HF radar fields; 3. Model trajectories and quantify their skill through comparisons with in-situ drifter tracks; and 4. Compute redistribution kernel functions (RKFs), or connectivity matrices, and demonstrate their utility as simple probabilistic near-shore transport models. Existing trajectory models will be modified for consideration of flow patterns characteristic to the coastal ocean. A model with a large-scale mean component (U), a periodic component representing tidal and (near-) inertial motions (Up), and a Lagrangian stochastic component (model; LSM) for subgrid-scale motions (u) will be developed. The LSM will initially be based on high resolution drifter data. An LSM parameterization based on large-scale velocity information (e.g. integral time scales, eddy variance.) and coastal geomorphology will then be developed. This enables the trajectory models to be applied in all coastal regions with sufficient large-scale flow information. Model skill over a wide range of dynamic parameters (e.g. velocity, vorticity, eddy energy) will be quantified in the Santa Barbara (CA) and Miami (FL) coastal regions through comparisons with in-situ drifter tracks. RKFs, giving the probability that a particle released at some location x0 at time t0 will reach location x1 at t1, will be computed with modeled trajectories and evaluated as tools for predicting transport, or connectivity in the coastal ocean. An improved understanding of coastal circulation will result from subsequent identification of how and why RKFs vary spatially and temporally.",2004,2009

Light absorption by CDOM drives photochemical reactions and its light absorption often obscures our ability to diagnose biogeochemical processes from satellite ocean color imagery. CDOM is an optical property; hence, its concentration can be quantified synoptically over large spatial scales using satellite sensors or in situ from a host of autonomous platforms. Although land-ocean exchanges are well known sources of ocean CDOM, recent observations have shown that open ocean CDOM is created through in situ biogeochemical processes. Despite the importance of CDOM to ocean biogeochemistry, little is known about the chemical nature of CDOM in the open ocean in relation to its global distribution. In this continuation work, we will take the next step towards the first systematic global survey of CDOM in the world ocean and to use these observations in conjunction with data from the CLIVAR-Repeat Hydrography program to characterize CDOM and DOM in the open ocean.

However the two longest-lived Pacific hotspot tracks the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville seamount chains exhibit hard-to-explain differences in behavior prior to 45 Ma: (i) The Hawaiian-Emperor show a pronounced ‚Äúkink‚Äù while the Louisville chain is gently curved and (ii) while the Louisville hotspot likely remained geographically fixed (results of recent IODP Expedition 330) Hawaii drifted 15¬∞ south. Differences in hotspot fixity may arise from ridge capture and ridge-related flow modifying plume upwelling the mantle wind tilting plumes movement of the plume base or large-scale reorganizations of tectonic plates affecting global mantle flow. As a result these complicating processes diminish the accuracy of APM models for the Pacific Plate in particular and our understanding of mantle dynamics in general. We propose that adding a third long-lived Pacific hotspot track can help to deconvolve the effects of plate versus plume motions. Recent evidence suggests that the Rurutu hotspot is long-lived (~100 Ma) follows a hotspot track midway between Hawaii and Louisville and shows a pronounced 155¬∞ bend like Hawaii between 35-55 Ma. Combining Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf geochemical and 40Ar/39Ar age data will allow us to test the hypothesis that the Rurutu hotspot is both geochemically continuous and and possibly the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific. We propose to obtain new age and geochemical data for the critical region around the poorly characterized Rurutu hotspot bend. This data will help define a third Pacific hotspot track that will help deconvolve plate from plume motions between 40 and 80 Ma. Specifically we propose to test the following two hypotheses: (1) The Rurutu hotspot is a long-lived geochemically-distinct hotspot like the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots; and (2) the Rurutu hotspot exhibits a pronounced bend and the timing of the Rurutu bend matches the timing of the (pronounced) Hawaii-Emperor and (less pronounced) Louisville bends at ~50 Ma. To test these hypotheses we propose to: (1) Dredge 20 key volcanoes at the Rurutu hotspot bend--defined by the intersection of the Tuvalu and Samoa chains--to determine its precise location and timing; (2) Geochemically characterize 60 samples to evaluate a link to the modern-day Rurutu hotspot; (3) Compare the predicted Rurutu age progression from various APM models to 45 new 40Ar/39Ar ages to be measured from these seamounts. This data from the Rurutu hotspot will allow us to trace the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific and construct an APM model for the Pacific Plate that is less sensitive to plume motion.

Biophysical models, consisting of ocean circulation models combined with Lagrangian particle tracking, are now widely used to provide insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of larval connectivity that remain unobtainable through empirical approaches. However, many of the biological assumptions used to characterize larval life history in these models are quite general and the impacts of these assumptions have yet to be rigorously tested. Our goal in this proposal is to quantify How important are the details of larval biology in estimates of connectivity and long- term population dynamics? To answer this question, we propose to study the spatial and temporal impacts of larval biological factors on site-to-site connectivity and long- term population growth using a biophysical model for nearshore species in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Four major, larval biological factors will be investigated: (1) temperature effects on larval growth, maturation and mortality, (2) vertical swimming behavior, (3) spatial/temporal variability in larval production, and (4) role of habitat on settlement. Using a biophysical model of the SCB, differences in larval connectivity due to the biological factors will be assessed statistically by comparing connectivity estimates that incorporate the additional biological factors to a baseline of connectivity estimates calculated from passive, neutrally buoyant particles. We will also employ a spatial demographic model, driven by the connectivity estimates, to quantify the influence of biological factors on long-term population dynamics. The proposed work will generate significant insights into the various aspects of larval biology that are critical for determining larval connectivity and for projecting population dynamics into the future.

This phase of experiments was initiated in 2010 and 2011 following ocean drilling operations to install observatory infrastructure and instrument systems deep below the seafloor. We have combined a series of short-term and long-term pumping and discharge experiments lasing hours to years with a multi-tracer injection experiment to quantify solute dissolved gas and particle flow velocities directions and crustal interactions. Hydrogeologic experiments like these have been performed on land to elucidate conditions in hydrocarbon reservoirs and freshwater aquifers but they have never before been attempted in the ocean crust. Using the same boreholes we are monitoring natural pressure conditions and perturbations the extent of isothermality in the upper crust the chemical evolution of borehole and crustal fluids and the nature and extent of microbial growth in incubators containing chips of rock and minerals. Cross-hole pressure perturbations have been observed and sparse wellhead sampling of fluids from one borehole has recovered tracers injected in a different borehole (hundreds of meters away) demonstrating that the hydrogeologic and tracer experiments are working. But the most complete multi-year records of experimental results remain to be recovered. We request support for a 12-day ROV/submersible expedition to recover downhole instruments installed in the CORKs and to retrieve seafloor instruments and a final suite large volume samples then seal the boreholes for future use. Shore-based activities will include hydrogeologic and tracer analyses microbial characterization and integration of physical chemical and microbial data to constrain crustal conditions properties and processes.,2013,2015
Matthew Jackson,9/2/13,3/31/14,$392 ,National Science Foundation,Federal agencies,OCE-1419915,Constraining mantle flow between Samoa and the northern Lau and N. Fiji Basins with geochemistry and geodynamics,Numerous geochemical and geophysical anomalies within the northern portion of the Lau basin-- the presence of high 3He/4He (up to 28 times atmospheric) latitudinal gradients in trace element and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb) enrichment and trench parallel shear wave splitting near the Tonga arc-- have been attributed to southward flow of mantle material from the nearby Samoan hotspot. However both the total extent and the spatial distribution of any intrusion of Samoanplume mantle into the region are poorly constrained. We propose to use a combination of geochemical analysis and geodynamic modeling to test two hypotheses regarding advection of material from the Samoan plume into the northern Lau basin: 1. The observed North-South gradients in Sr Nd and Pb isotopic ratios reflect progressive depletion of southward flowing Samoan-plume mantle. 2. The western extent of the Samoan plume's influence in the region extends into the northwestern Lau and North Fiji basins. We will perform geochemical analyses on samples from 12 key sites within the northwest Lau and northern North Fiji basins selected to fill important geographic voids in existing geochemical data sets. We will geochemically characterize (He Sr Nd and Pb isotopes and trace elements) a suite of 28 existing lava samples along a swath covering the northern region of the Lau and North Fiji basins. These data will greatly extend the western limit of geochemical observations in the region while simultaneously improving the resolution of North-South variations in isotopic ratios at the northern extreme of the northwest Lau and North Fiji basins. He isotopic measurements which are the most unambiguous geochemical indicator of the presence of Samoan-plume mantle will be particularly important for identifying the (currently unconstrained) western limit of Samoan intrusion. We will conduct a series of numerical geodynamic experiments to characterize melting of isotopically enriched Samoan-plume mantle by decompression as it flows southward across the boundary between old (>100 Ma) thick Pacific oceanic lithosphere and the young (<5 Ma) thin oceanic lithosphere of the Lau basin in the vicinity of the Vitiaz lineament. The resulting predicted spatial patterns in mantle depletion will be compared to the observed North-South geochemical gradients in the basins and the data obtained in this study to place constraints on the morphology of mantle flow in the region.,2013,2014

Two critical problem areas warrant accelerated research effort: 1) incorporating vegetation response into hydrologic models to better predict availability of late summer water for human consumption and ecosystem services, and 2) developing novel and rigorous predictions of the extent of stream network changes under changing climate, with direct consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms. Dr. Tague’s research will focus on problem 1) as described below. Incorporating vegetation response into hydrologic models. Spatially distributed modeling of both vegetation and hydrology at watershed to landscape scales have matured dramatically over the past decade. Such models offer a sound basis for predicting and testing how changing climate is likely to impact water resources and forest ecosystems. In particular, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) is one of the most sophisticated models coupling hydrology, vegetation dynamics, and nutrient and carbon cycling in response to both climate and land use drivers. Our previous work with RHESSys has allowed us to make significant progress in characterizing how summer streamflow from landscapes underlain by geologies differing in their hydrologic “plumbing systems”, specifically the degree to which subsurface flow is dominated by deep or shallow groundwater systems, vary in response to climate change. We now propose to extend this work by using RHESSys to explore whether vegetation changes, including those in response to changing fire regimes, exert an equally important control on summer streamflow. We will focus on catchments in the Cascade Range of Oregon for which we have already calibrated RHESSys, thereby expediting the work, and will incorporate recent findings from the Wind River Canopy Crane and H.J. Andrews Forest to parameterize evapotranspiration (ET), soil moisture and sapflow components of the model. Results from this effort will examine how warmer climate and earlier snowmelt will affect late summer streamflow, either by changing ET or through direct vegetation change (i.e., replacement of conifers by riparian alders following disturbance).",2008,2009

Hunter Lenihan,7/1/10,6/30/11,"$33,288 ",UC Sea Grant College Program,UC-wide,R/FISH-213EPD-TR,MPA-Based Collaborative Techniques to Improve Management of Nearshore Fisheries,Spatially structured data poor stocks are among the most valuable fisheries in California. Effective management of these stocks is suboptimal due to the lack of stock status indicators and unknown quantitative reference points. Stock assessments are the basic framework for computing stock status indicators yet many nearshore species lack the necessary data to perform traditional stock assessments. Moreover many stocks in the nearshore environment are governed by metapopulation dynamics (Gunderson et al. 2006) in which discrete populations are connected via larval dispersal (Kritzer and Sale 2004). For these species traditional coast-wide assessments are insufficient to account for differences in mortality rates growth rates reproductive patterns and harvest pressure between sub populations (Francis et al. 2008) thus reducing the potential to set harvest levels at predetermined target levels. The spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) is an economically culturally and ecologically important species in California. During the 2007-‚Äô08 fishing season for example 167 active commercial permits landed 306t (metric) with an ex- vessel value of ~$7.22 million. A vigorous recreational fishery is also formed around this species and initial analyses of recreational report cards issued by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) suggest that this sector contributes significantly to the total catch. In December of 2009 the authors participated in a workshop convened by CDFG that outlined needs and objectives for completion of a stock assessment by December 2010. Stock assessment biologists and independent consultants (Marine Stewardship Council) have determined that estimates of fishing mortality natural mortality and growth rates are critical to performing a robust assessment of the spiny lobster resource. California‚Äôs nearshore finfish fishery targets multiple species using hook-and-line and trap gear. Although the total statewide volume of commercial landings in the nearshore groundfish fishery has been modest in recent years (224 tons landed commercially in California waters in 2006) many of theA(and net revenues of $2.2 million in 2006). Grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) is one of the predominantly landed stocks of the 19 species managed under the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan (Nearshore FMP 2002). Sufficient data to evaluate stock status of grass rockfish and a majority of the other species in the Nearshore FMP are unavailable and therefore the complex is managed using the precautionary approach (Restrepo et al. 1998). The Reauthorization of the Magnuson Act now requires the setting of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) for all US fisheries. To effectively set ACLs novel methods must be developed and utilized for these data poor species. The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along the California coast (MLPA) offers tremendous potential for managers to use these zones to guide decision making at local scales. No-take MPAs may serve as proxies for unfished populations at specific locations. By comparing MPAs to adjacent fished areas that experience similar environmental conditions it may be possible to calculate natural mortality and fishing mortality rates as well as design methods that set sustainable harvest levels at local scales. We have developed two novel methods for utilizing data from MPAs to inform fisheries management decisions for the nearshore and spiny lobster fisheries: (1) A decision tree model (Wilson et al. 2010) that can be used to set ACLs and (2) a length structured model that uses growth models and size structure data from inside and outside reserves to calculate rates of natural and fishery- imposed mortality. For spiny lobster the growth and mortality models developed in this proposal and the resulting outputs will be directly utilized in the upcoming stock assessment being performed by Doug Neilson of CDFG. We are in direct contact with Dr. Neilson and he has expressed a need for these data as soon as possible thus the urgency of this research is immediate. The decision tree-ACL model developed in this proposal and the recommended harvest levels for grass rockfish will be published in peer reviewed journals with the expectation of becoming a tool in the CDFG and NOAA Fisheries toolbox for setting ACLs which is also of immediate urgency. NOAA and CDFG stock assessment biologists with whom we collaborate (Alec MacCall ‚Äì NOAA Meisha Key ‚Äì CDFG) have expressed confidence that the decision tree- ACL model will be an accurate and practical tool for setting catch limits.,2010,2011
Thomas Dunne Erin Bray,4/1/11,9/30/13,"$102,876 ",UC Sea Grant College Program,UC-wide,R/SF-49,Effect of Direct and Interactive Disturbances of the Streamflow Regime of the Middle San Joaquin River on Key Instream Abiotic Drivers of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) Habitat,This research proposal describes computational research and supplemental field/data collection in ecohydrology and river quality modeling to characterize how variations in flow regime relate to instream abiotic conditions in order to provide favorable habitat for Chinook salmon in Reach 1 of the Middle San Joaquin River. The aim of this project is to develop a pair of interlocking dynamic models and field analyses to quantify the availability and distribution of stream temperature dissolved oxygen and sediment conditions that support Chinook populations. This will be done by coupling an existing hydrodynamic model with an existing stream network population model to 1) perturb existing flow releases from the Friant Dam (timing frequency magnitude duration rate of change) 2) advance our understanding of habitat suitability across gradients of temperature and dissolved oxygen 3) predict fish population response to direct and interactive flow/habitat disturbances and 5) identify critical cause and effect pathways to defining a restored ecosystem for Chinook salmon throughout the Bay Delta. Doing so gives rise to emergent complex dynamics that can be examined only through an integrated study of flow abiotic effects and fish populations. Each of these has a potentially unique spatial signature that is in part controlled by hydrograph manipulation and fish will thrive only where all of these coincide. Planning for flow releases in Bay Delta systems may be better informed if we understand the abiotic and ecological significance.,2011,2013

Their increased band gap means that they function as strong oxidizing and/or reducing agents and their small size allows them to pass into living cells. Conjugation of biomolecules to the crystal surface can alter any or all of these properties. In preliminary experiments we observed that only bioconjugated CdSe quantum dots are taken up by bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Intracellular fluorescence varies apparently by electron transfer-mediated quenching and nanoparticle breakdown. Bare quantum dots are as toxic to growing bacteria as Cd2+ implying possible extracellular breakdown but subsequent fates and toxicity relationships are unknown. Particle size dependencies are implied but insufficiently understood for use in risk analysis. A systematic inquiry into size- and chemistry-dependent uptake and fate processes is needed. We propose to quantify cellular-scale processes that affect nanoparticle entry stability and toxicity for a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic cells. We will focus on two nanoparticles CdSe whose metals are toxic and TiO2 whose toxicity arises solely from its size and electron transfer activity. Both short term ‚Äòlabeling‚Äô and longer term growth experiments will be performed to quantify particle entry into cells and toxicity; we will also study energy transfer between nanoparticles and energized membranes as a mechanism. The relative importance of near-cell breakdown whole- particle electron scavanging and intracellular particle reformation as fates will be quantified. This project will show how nanoparticles and cells may cooperate in transmembrane transport as well as toxicity. This research will be used to predict cellular-scale exposure and toxicity for bacteria and eukaryotes in soil and water.

Naomi Tague,7/1/11,6/30/14,"$86,251 ",Oregon State University,Institutes of higher education,S1343H-A,Ecohydrological Component of Willamette Water 2100 Project,"Watershed scale paired-catchment experiments have clearly demonstrated that the relationship between vegetation and streamflow varies strongly with geographic and climatic settings. Process-based modeling provides a non-destructive method to generalize results from site specific field studies to a broad range of scenarios characterized by climate, geomorphology, species type and disturbance regimes within a given region. This proposed work explores these interactions through a series of five questions designed such that the knowledge gained from one step informs the next. Broadly, this work focuses on how streamflow is influenced in a forested, temperate watershed with particular attention to growth/regeneration processes and climate. Specifically, the questions emphasize abiotic, biotic and disturbance themes: 1. Abiotic: How does the timing of water inputs (snowmelt, rain v. snow partitioning) change forest AET/PET? How do soil storage and vegetation characteristics influence this relationship between timing and AET/PET? 2. Biotic: How does a dynamic carbon allocation cycling strategy (fixed ratio, age-based, resource-based) in conifers influence the streamflow response under current climate conditions? And with warmer temperatures? 3. Disturbance: a.Spatial: How does streamflow respond to a change in forest species at variable spatial extents—i.e., entire watershed versus the riparian zone? b.Temporal: How does the trajectory of post-fire recovery of biomass and associated hydrologic response vary with inter-annual climate variability? Does this relationship change under a warmer climate? 4. What climate conditions would push Doug Fir to widespread mortality in the Cascades? We initially approach these questions using Lookout Creek as our study site. Lookout Creek is a 64 sq-km watershed within the McKenzie River basin. Elevation ranges within the watershed frequently include the rain-snow transition zone, thus it is likely to be highly sensitive to climate warming. We address our research questions using RHESSys, a coupled ecohydrological model designed to represent feedbacks between hydrologic and vegetation carbon cycling processes (http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~rhessys/). This project builds on an existing implementation or RHESSys for Lookout Creek. Vegetation in the basin will be represented by a single canopy layer composed of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Red alder (Alnus rubra). Topography (and finest spatial resolution) will be represented with a 30-m digital elevation model (DEM) (available through the HJA data portal http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/) and soil depth map (developed by Vache and McDonnell). Historical climate recorded at CS2Met will be used as baseline temperature and precipitation inputs at a daily time scale with PRISM data sets used for spatial scaling of temperature and precipitation. Model performance will be evaluated using daily streamflow records and published estimates of aboveground net primary productivity1,2,3. Additionally, model estimates of canopy height will be checked against a recently completed LIDAR survey and sapflow data of stands of different age in W1 will be used to check calculated transpiration. After we have gained a process-based understanding of key linkages between vegetation change and streamflow at the Lookout Creek scale, we will use the model to explore scenarios at a larger spatial scale, the 2409 sq-km basin of McKenzie River at Vida. The future scenarios will be developed in conjunction with other researchers in the WW2100 project and will include changes in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and shifts in species types and ranges.",2011,2014

Carter Ohlmann,3/15/11,2/28/15,"$252,733 ",Oregon State University,Institutes of higher education,S1364A-A,DYNAmics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation / DYNAMO Subsurface Fluxes,"Solar radiation plays a primary role in the diurnal (mixed layer) stratification process influencing both daytime EKE dissipation and setting up nighttime convection (e.g. Simpson and Dickey 1981, Price et al. 1986, Brainerd and Gregg 1993, Hosegood et al. 2008). Direct measurement of the in-water solar flux divergence, or radiant heating rates, allows variations in solar forcing of stratification, that can be significant, to be accurately quantified (e.g. Ohlmann et al. 1996, Ohlmann et al. 1998, Ohlmann et al. 2000, Hosegood et al. 2008). Solar attenuation depends primarily on upper ocean chlorophyll biomass concentration in open ocean waters. Chlorophyll biomass depends (to first order) on the availability of light and nutrients. When measured together, these data inform on bio-physical feedbacks. This statement of work describes the proposed measurement of surface irradiance and in water solar flux profiles during the Dynamo field experiment. Collecting solar flux profiles allows upper ocean stratification, an important component of upper ocean mixed layer evolution, to be quantified. It is also proposed that water samples be collected for laboratory analysis of chlorophyll biomass and nutrients. These data are 152 necessary to understand why the in-water solar flux divergence varies, and the sampling adds little cost to the project. Upper ocean models work with solar transmission, defined as solar flux at depth relative to the incident value just above the surface. Surface irradiance will thus be sampled with a radiometer mounted on the ship’s mast. The complete data set, to be collected throughout the MJO-evolution cruises, will provide the necessary solar transmission information for accurate quantification of upper-ocean mixing, and will allow the bio-physical influence on stratification/dissipation to be better understood. Profiles of downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance in 11 spectral bands (~300 to ~700 nm) will be measured using a Satlantic Profiler II Radiometer (www.satlantic.com/profiler). The radiometer is a long (122 cm) slender (9 cm in diameter) hand-deployed freefalling instrument (retrieved using a small winch) that eludes ship motion and shadow. Coincident measurements of downwelling spectral irradiance and total solar radiation incident at the surface will be made so that solar transmission profiles can be computed. It is estimated that solar flux profiles will be made to ~40 meters every few hours each day. It is possible that profiles in the morning and evening hours, when total solar energy is reduced, can be made shallower. Water samples at discrete depths will be collected once each day with the ship’s CTD/Rosette system and analyzed for chlorophyll concentration and nutrients. The noontime CTD/Rosette casts will be performed to ~150 meters so that the deep chlorophyll maximum and nutricline are resolved. The radiometer primarily resolves the visible portion of the entire solar spectrum. This is sufficient to resolve the solar flux at depths beneath ~5 m as energy in the ultra-violet and near-infrared spectral regions is completely attenuated in the top few meters of the ocean.",2011,2015

For California this interest provides an opportunity both to help achieve GHG reduction targets as well as boosting economic opportunities for farmers. Potential impacts on habitat and biodiversity however have been largely neglected in the dialog in California and globally. Impacts could be substantial (though not necessarily negative) at the level of production needed to significantly supplant fossil fuels. In fact some energy crops such as perennial grasses have the potential to restore degraded agricultural landscapes and improve its habitat value for imperiled species.

Microbiological measurements of water samples collected within the plume will allow for characterizing bacterial indicators, indicator DNA, bacterial communities, and bacterial pathogens indicative of contamination (Holden, UCSB). While drifters provide a direct measure of transport pathways taken by surface water parcels, microbiological measurements provide 148 direct measures of microbial contaminant concentrations, as well as indigenous microbes, associated with the plume. Microbial communities associated with wastewater effluent discharged from the Montecito outfall are likely to be complex and distinct from the indigenous ocean microbial ecology, with subgroups and populations changing at varying rates due to multiple loss mechanisms occurring along the plume trajectory. While dispersion and eddy diffusion values (i.e. mixing rates) are accurately obtained from drifter data by considering the relative motion of drifter pairs, the application of these values to dynamic analyses, such as organisms, cannot be used to directly and completely predict the movement of organisms within the plume. Rather, a coupled fate and transport model of microbes within the plume trajectory will be developed based on measured concentrations of microbial constituents in space and time, advection and dispersion characteristics of the water, and nominated loss coefficients for individual groups of microbes. Loss coefficients will be estimated within the plume model by performing sensitivity analyses and discovering appropriately conservative bounds for estimated values. Overall, measurements of water properties, including microbiological contaminants, and subsurface current velocities will characterize the ambient ocean conditions, as well as the effects of effluent discharge on water quality around the outfall.",2007,2010

Nanoparticles (NPs) are likely to demonstrate unique environmental behavior due to their larger surface/volume ratio high surface activity and quantum confinement effects. Many NPs are soluble in water. Even for insoluble NPs they may be functionalized to increase their affinity for the aqueous phase. Thus the aqueous phase is an important pathway for NPs. Natural organic matter (NOM) is the decomposition product of biota consisting of polyelectrolytes with varying molecular sizes (Hyung and Kim 2008). Ionization of carboxylic and phenolic moieties make NOM negatively charged. In the aqueous phase the ubiquitous NOM may bind with NPs and influence the dispersability stability and mobility of NOM-NP complexes. Recent studies have reported on the stabilization of carbon nanotubes in the presence of NOM (e.g. Hyung et. al. 2007; Wang et al. 2008). Also the hindrance and facilitation effects of NOM on fullerene (C60) aggregation at different ionic strengths have also been reported (Chen and Elimelech 2007). This research project aims to study the effect of NOM and humic acid (HA) on NP aggregation and attachment processes and the underlying interaction mechanisms in different water matrices. In addition key solution chemistry parameters such as pH ionic strength (IS) and the ratio of monovalent/divalent cations will be considered. Preliminary results from our lab show that ZnO can be stabilized by NOM in aqueous systems (Table 1 in Appendix); also NOM-ZnO complexes exhibit opposing effects with regards to aggregation under different IS and pH conditions (Tables 2 and 3 in Appendix). The hypotheses to be tested in this project include: (1) the surface charge of NPs and the electrostatic interaction between NPs will be changed after binding with NOM; (2) NOM will improve the aqueous stability of hydrophobic NPs by increasing their surface hydrophilicity; (3) NOM will facilitate the partial disaggregation of NPs at low IS and assist in the aggregation of NPs at high IS. (4) NOM will decrease the attachment efficiency of NPs to natural particles by enhancing the electrostatic repulsion force between NP and natural particles since most natural particles are also negatively charged. We expect that this will result in increased mobility of NOM-NP complexes.,2008,2009

The objectives of this research are to: elucidate transport behaviors of QDs obtain microbial toxicological data from a partner lab engaged in QD research conduct a baseline risk assessment and to develop policy recommendations. Batch experiments will be conducted in which the kinetics stability and aggregation behavior of QDs in aqueous solution will be studied. The kinetics stability and aggregation behavior of QDs will also be studied with natural aqueous matrices. This study will utilize an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to characterize the shape and level of aggregation of QDs in aqueous samples. Transport investigations will be accomplished by conducting column experiments.

However our understanding fecal pollution in coastal ecosystems as well as our ability to identify and mitigate its sources is greatly limited by the uncertainties surrounding its behavior in two major reservoirs: wetlands and beach sediments. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens can enter coastal creeks and rivers from upland sources but near-shore beach sources are also significant reservoirs and coastal wetlands have been shown to both increase and decrease the levels of FIB in water. This field and laboratory based study was developed as an examination and assessment of sources levels and pathways of pathogens in coastal wetlands and sediments a priority research area. The research had two core focus areas. The first focus area involved conducting field surveys in tandem with laboratory analysis for human specific markers in four coastal wetlands and beaches. The second focus area was a laboratory based systematic investigation of factors contributing to pathogen and pathogen indicator transport and fate in sediments. This research was multi-institutional involving UCR UCLA and UCSB. UCSB performed primary field and laboratory research at the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve in support of the first focus area. UCLA was a collaborating institution. Field sampling was designed to determine the origins of fecal indicator bacteria the presence of human waste markers and spatiotemporal patterns relative to tidal influences. Human waste markers were discovered and tidal stage was related to fecal indicator bacterial levels. Data analysis is ongoing in support of preparing a manuscript for peer review.,2008,2010

Recent improvement in access in part due to a new gold rush makes it possible to produce the first geologic maps of a large sector of this province and date the volcanic and intrusive rocks.

Arturo Keller,10/1/09,6/30/10,"$10,000 ",University of California,UC-wide,SB100031,UV Irradiation of Nanoparticles in Natural Water Systems,Very little is known about the environmental chemistry of nanomaterials (NMs). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the quenching of ROS are two important reactions in natural aqueous systems where NMs may have an impact 1 2. The potential increased generation of ROS by photoactivated nanomaterials as well as being highly reactive can more readily degrade planktonic algae and other important organics thus influencing the productivity of an ecosystem 3. Increased ROS generation can also more efficiently render labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) into mineralized CO2. The increased recalcitrance of DOM may decrease microbial degradation rates of DOM and can potentially decrease the productivity of an ecosystem 4. Additionally the increased concentration of ROS can potentially lead to increased interactions of radicals with the biota. Electron transfer quenching by nanomaterials is also an important reaction. During electron-hole pair recombination some nanomaterials can scavenge an electron and thus decrease the natural ROS generation. The objective is to investigate the ability of nanosize metal oxides to increase or quench the generation of ROS in simulated freshwater and seawater systems. The ROS production and quenching kinetics will be investigated using a xenon arc lamp to irradiate a photoreactor.,2009,2010
Arturo Keller,10/1/09,6/30/10,"$10,000 ",University of California,UC-wide,SB100032,Role of Material Properties on the Aggregation of Nanoparticles in Natural Waters. Introduction,The potential toxicity of emerging nanomaterials has drawn significant attention in the past few years. Investigations have shown various negative effects of nanomaterials to plants phytoplankton mammals and even human cell lines (Xia 2008; Franklin 2007; Lin 2008;). To fully assess the environmental risk of nanomaterials the information of how these materials transport and transform and in which forms these materials reach organisms and cause negative effects is indispensable. In the aqueous environment nanoparticles (NPs) tend to attract each other and form aggregates (Chen and Elimelech 2006). This process influences the mobility of NPs and determines their final sink. In the current effort of the UC CEIN in investigating nanomaterials‚Äô environmental impact understanding how nanoparticles aggregate is key for the toxicological assessment. This information helps IRGs2 and 3 to predict in which form and at what particle size will nanoparticles be present in their mesocosm waters. Such knowledge is also indispensable for the multi-media modeling endeavor of IRG 6. The first year of this project focused on understanding the role of solution chemistry on NPs‚Äô aggregation. It is seen that pH and ionic strength both influence NPs‚Äô aggregation by manipulating particles‚Äô surface charge and that the concentration of NP changes the aggregation rate by altering the collision rate. In addition natural organic matters (NOM) have been shown to stabilize NPs by increasing the electrostatic repulsion between particles. These results have been verified by our studies with natural waters from IRG 2 and 3. In addition to solution chemistry NP aggregation is controlled by material properties. For instance the surface charge of nanoparticles may vary with size due to the change in low- coordination number sites at surface edges and steps (Guzman 2006). Particle size crystal structure surface coating and doping all have impacts on NP aggregation (Klane 2008). Therefore in the second year of this project I propose to study the role of material properties on NP aggregation. Specifically the following hypotheses will be tested: (1) traditional DLVO theory (take electric double layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction into account) is not sufficient to describe the aggregation mechanism (Guzman 2006) hydrophobic hydration and/or Born interaction may be involved in NP aggregation; (2) primary particle size of NP may play a role in aggregation by influencing point of zero charge (PZC) the abundance of surface functional groups as well as aggregate fractal dimension; (3) differences in crystal structure for a given material may lead to distinct aggregation kinetics; (4) morphology of nanoparticles may shape their aggregation process.,2009,2010

Quantitative assessments typically consider a single source whereas qualitative assessments may include multiple sources but rarely identify response variables. As a step toward understanding cumulative effects of underwater sound we are developing complementary quantitative and qualitative methods for assessing the aggregated sounds from multiple sources received by marine mammals. As a case study to refine the transferable methods we are assessing sounds received by migrating bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea during their 2008 autumn migration. The quantitative method models the sound field from multiple sources and simulates movement of a population through it. The qualitative method uses experts to assess responses of individuals and populations to sound sources and identify potential mechanisms. These methods increase the transparency of assessments.,2010,2014
Sangwon Suh,1/3/11,1/2/12,"$112,000 ",Exxon Mobile Corporation,"Private agency, foundation",SB100081,Incorporating Water Quality and Quantity in Water-Use Impact Assessment Modeling for Life Cycle Assessment: With Case Studies of Coal and Natural Gas-powered Electricity Generation,"Water quality issue has been traditionally handled in other impact categories such as human health and ecosystem health in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Therefore, we will explore how water quality issue can be incorporated into mid-point approach and then integrated into water quantity issue after weighting. In parallel, we will explore the possibilities of combining water quality and water quantity issues into ecologically degraded area following end-point approach. An example of a simplified classification of water use categories can be drawn from looking at a nuclear power plant, as it withdraws water from a stream and part of the water withdrawn will be evaporated to the atmosphere and will not immediately come back to the same source of water, and the rest will come back to the water stream with certain quality alteration. The consumptive use portion of water withdrawn will not be available to the neighboring ecosystem, and therefore it adversely affects the production of water-constrained NPP of the area. This impact can be modeled using the framework developed by Pfister et al. (2009). However, the framework by Pfister et al. (2009) is not adequate for addressing the impacts associated with degradative use portion of the withdrawal. In order to quantify the impact of degradative use of water, we propose the following two approaches. A. Mid-point approach Use of acute toxicity data such as lethal concentration 50 (LC50) or chronic toxicity data such as no observed effect concentration (NOEC) is widely adopted to mid-point approaches for quantifying ecosystem health impacts (Guinée et al., 2002; Wenzel et al., 1997; Wenzel and Hauschild, 1997). In these approaches the impact of various human interventions to ecosystem 207 health is quantified using either the concentration of a pollutant that harms 50% of the total population of a certain species or the maximum level of intervention without observed effect. The impact of water quality alteration can be translated into relevant mid-point characterization factors following the same reasoning. For instance, it has long been known that certain larvae are highly sensitive to alteration of water temperature by power plants (see e.g., Hall, 1979). In this case, temperature-response curve provides similar data required to calculate characterization factors for ecosystem health impacts. Once degradative water use is quantified using mid-point approach, the result can be integrated with consumptive water use results by using normalization and weighting procedure (ISO 2006; Guinée et al., 2002). B. End-point approach Another option is to translate the damage on higher trophic level into NPP and use the ecologically degraded area following Pfister et al. (2009). Energy captured by NPP is partly transferred to the species in higher trophic level along the food-chain, and the rest is dissipated through respiration and decay. Therefore, in principle, the amount of energy held by certain species can be translated into NPP using energy balance approach (Suh, 2005). Under this framework, damages to the species in higher trophic level will have larger “NPP equivalency” as more energy is lost along the food web as it propagates. We will develop the framework using each of the two approaches. The two approaches will be compared using case studies on coal- and natural gas-powered electricity generation process. The case study will be based on life-cycle impact considering all direct and supply-chain water uses impacts.",2011,2012
Leila Carvalho Charles Jones,4/15/10,3/31/12,"$50,000 ",USAID,Federal agencies,SB100085,Statistical Physics Climatic Downscaling: Combining Wavelet Multifractal and Neural Network Approaches in a Unified Scaling Methodology,The specific research problem addressed by this study is the development of a downscaling model based on wavelet-multifractal and artificial neural network approaches to generate climate data at appropriate temporal (daily) and spatial (20 Km) scales using global circulation model outputs. Although computational performances have increased exponentially in the last few years there are still strong limitations in global climate modeling in simulating regional processes on short spatial and temporal time-scales. As of today most Global Climate Models (GCMs) have typical horizontal resolution of 150-300 km with 30-50 vertical layers. Much of the improved computational resources have been used to incorporate more sophisticated physical parameterizations interactive earth system components and ensemble simulations of extended lengths. To date major model biases remain in global climate simulations that limit their ability to provide climate information with sufficient reliability and spatial specificity for societal use. Perhaps the most persistent and pervasive biases are related to the representation of the hydrological cycle. Consequences of an inaccurate hydrological cycle in fully coupled GCM simulations of the climate system are far reaching since water integrates the physical biological and chemical components. Most climate change projections are currently based on models that simulate coupled atmospheric and oceanic processes on coarse resolutions. Among the most important impacts of regional-scale predictions of climate changes is on food production and security. Simulations on regional scales of precipitation and temperature are absolutely crucial to understand how global warming will affect fresh water storage and the ability to grow potato wheat corn and other staples. Dynamical regional model simulations using GCMs as boundary conditions have been largely applied but challenges in this area still abounds. In some cases improvements to GCMs are considered marginal given the necessary computational efforts. The objective of the present work is to develop a downscaling statistical model based on wavelet- multifractal and artificial neural network approaches. The focus of this analysis will be on South America and on the regional modeling of temperature and precipitation. More specifically our objectives are: 1) Implement some existing stochastic downscaling models based on cascade techniques such as spatial disaggregation (Sharma et al. 2007) multiplicative random cascade (Srestha et al. 2004) or rainfall downscaling in a space-time multifractal (Deidda 2000). 2) Review and assess different empirical statistical downscaling models and performance of statistical downscaling models in GCM validation and regional climate change estimation. 3) Compare the empirical statistical downscaling models with simulations of the present climate with the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) over eastern South America. 4) Elaborate a complementary new proposal to be submitted to NSF to expand the present study to other regions and meteorological variables.,2010,2012

For hydrological connectivity small sections of surrounding states will also be modeled. For those major tributaries that are not yet modeled (e.g. HUC 0502 Monongahela) and that drain into this section of the Ohio River we will use the ORSANCO monitoring data as a placeholder for the flows and loads from these watersheds. This proposed project will benefit from our existing efforts funded by USEPA since we have already established the connections with Ohio EPA and ORSANCO to obtain the needed point source and observed water quality information. Implementing the model involves obtaining a number of datasets such as topography (digital elevation model) hydrologic network and observed hydrology from USGS; land use data from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset supplemented with the 2008 Cropland Survey for Ohio from USDA; point source and water quality observations data from Ohio EPA; ORSANCO monitoring data.The TWG project has allowed us to develop a number of software tools and algorithms for processing these large datasets to more rapidly implement each new watershed. If we did not have these tools the cost of implementing the model for these three HUCs (0503 0508 and 0509) would be approximately twice the proposed budget given the large area considered. The watersheds will be modeled at the 10-digit HUC level as shown in Figure 2. For practical purposes the models are implemented as distinct subwatersheds that can be run independently or together in a master project. Thus if someone needs to run a scenario for a small section within a watershed it is not necessary to run the entire master model. Data set collection and incorporation into the model will take approximately 3 months. Once the model is implemented and calibrated the model will be used to develop the ‚Äútrading coefficients‚Äù for the entire state of Ohio. This involves evaluating the effect of a load reduction in a given location and its impact on the rest of the downstream watersheds. A matrix of the trading coefficients will be generated for use in the broader WQT program. The matrix will also be displayed graphically using ArcView or any other accepted Geographical Information System software. A number (approx. 20) of trading scenarios within Ohio will be evaluated to illustrate the use of the model for WQT. The final report will detail the model implementation calibration analysis of the WQT scenarios and an explanation of the trading coefficient matrix.

Chen Ji,7/1/11,6/30/12,"$1,160 ",University of California,UC-wide,SB120026,Modeling of Large Earthquakes in the Mexican Subduction Zone: Estimating the Distribution of Slip During an Hypothetical Earthquake,Mexico is an earthquake prone country with a long history of loss of life and property in devastating seismic events. The Department of Seismology at the IGF (Institute of Geophysics) at UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de exico) is now coordinating a project to prepare for the scientific response to such an earthquake. The scientific response includes estimating the parameters of the earthquake such as the location orientation and size of the fault plane the magnitude and pattern of slip the possible effects of the earthquakes as well as the response to measure aftershocks. Currently the researchers at UNAM do not have access to tools that could integrate all the available (synthetic) data sets to estimate the slip on the fault plane. However we here at UCSB have extensive experience with this type of analysis and have developed software that integrates seismograms recorded in the vicinity of the earthquake those recorded at seismic stations around the world and the permanent surface displacements recorded close to the earthquake. This project seeks to fund the visit of one of the researchers at IGF of UNAM to specifically: Visit UCSB to learn to incorporate all the available data sets to model the pattern of co-seismic slip during a large earthquake in Mexico and generally to initiate a collaboration between the IGF at UNAM and UCSB in the modeling of large earthquakes in Mexico.,2011,2012

This work will allow us to increase understanding of where the need for interventions is greatest by helping to identify where human communities are most vulnerable to climate change driven increases in food insecurity. The IPCC defines vulnerable regions as regions where physical exposure of climate change is highest sensitivity of people and communities is greatest and where adaptive capacity is lowest. In this project the researcher will identify generate and map indicators of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity at the global scale that are relevant within the context of food security. More specifically and in close collaboration with various researchers within S&K the UCSB research will: 1) Identify develop and map spatially explicit indicators for defining exposure at the global scale with respect to agricultural systems and other food production systems. 2) Identify develop and map spatially explicit indicators for defining sensitivity at the global scale in those same systems. 3) Integrate the above layers following existing protocols and/or based on novel methodologies (as necessary) into a global map in order to define regions at risk of climate change driven increases in food insecurity. 4) Aid CI with general advice in defining and mapping of exposure sensitivity and potential EbA interventions.,2012,2012

In addition the funding will allow CCBER to maintain and enhance the GVLT restoration implemented over the past year. West Campus Bluffs is a 37 acre area with amazing coastal views, easy access and is a unique opportunity to restore coastal grassland. It was recently protected from development through the 2004 Ellwood-Devereux Joint Open Space Agreement. The joint management committee (City of Goleta, UCSB, County of Santa Barbara) have been meeting over the past three years to collaborate on planning efforts for restoration, trails and signs. CCBER has been working with the State Coastal Conservancy and Coastal Fund on restoration associated with the new decomposed granite trail that runs the length of the bluff and GVLT supported restoration of the eastern bluff edge. This trail brings people to the larger 652 open space area protected through the joint agreement. Excitingly, and with GVLT support, CCBER is simultaneously working with TPL to acquire and restore the upper arms of Devereux Slough and South parcel. Thus, this area is important both ecologically and as an important aesthetic and practical access point to popular surfing points, snowy plover protection areas and future large scale restoration projects. Over the past year CCBER has implemented restoration of the bluff (funded by GVLT) and the trail edge (Coastal Fund support). These successful projects have been enthusiastically welcomed by bluff trail users. The restored areas are still establishing and we feel that the most valuable path to follow is to continue to maintain those areas while expanding the restoration on the western end where there is a clear threat from fennel and the opportunity to link the trail restoration to the existing vernal meadows. This will not only greatly enhance the visitor experience of being on a natural, native coastal bluff, but will also protect and enhance the restoration that has already been implemented from future weed invasion.",2012,2013

Jordan Clark,8/1/12,7/31/13,"$21,109 ",City of Avalon,"California state, municipal agencies",SB130002,Linking coastal contamination to the local sewage system using a sulfer hexaflouride as deliberate tracer,As part of a larger study being conducted by Dr. Stanley Grant (UC Irvine) a deliberate tracer experiment will be initiated by the UCSB group using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The methodology to be used was developed by Dr. Jordan Clark at UCSB to investigate the movement (travel times) of artificially recharged water near spreading ponds. Dr. Clark‚Äôs group has conducted groundwater tracer experiments in numerous locations in southern California (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2008). His group has also used SF6 to investigate mine drainage contamination to Clear Lake (Schladow and Clark 2008) and dispersion in the Stockton Deep Water Shipping Channel (Schmieder et al. 2008). In all cases permission was asked for and granted to use SF6 as a tracer in California aquifers. During the initial phase of the proposed experiment tracer-rich water will be released into the sewer lines as a series of hourly slug additions over a tidal cycle. The tracer rich water will be created by equilibrating about 20 liters of water with pure SF6 in a closed container. I expect that the finally SF6 concentration to be more than 10% of the equilibrium value. During the second phase water samples will be collected at location along the beach in pre weighed 10 ml VacutainersTM and sent to UCSB for analysis. All SF6 samples will be analyzed using a headspace method similar to that described by Clark et al. (2004). The VacutainersTM will be partially filled (about 5 ml of water) in the field. At UCSB they will be weighed (to determine the sample size) and carefully filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen gas (so that the final head space pressure is equal to about 1 atmosphere). After a brief shaking to equilibrate the nitrogen gas with the water sample the headspace gas will be injected through a column of Mg(ClO4)2 (to remove water vapor) into a small sample loop of known volume (about 1 ml). Subsequently the gas in the sample loop will be flushed into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector with ultra-high purity nitrogen carrier gas. SF6 will be separated from other gases with a molecular sieve 5a column held at room temperature. The detector response will be determined by running gas standards purchased from Scott-Marrin Inc. With this method error on duplicate measurements is typically better than ¬±10%. Laboratory experiments have shown that SF6 samples can be stored for at least 6 months without appreciable loss of SF6 in VacutainerTM. The detection limit of this method is about 0.1 pmol/L so we will be able to detect sewer water after a 100000:1 dilution even if some SF6 is lost due to water-air gas transfer. SF6 a non-toxic and non-reactive gas is an ideal tracer of groundwater flow. It has been shown in laboratory experiments and during a field experiment conducted near Phoenix AZ that in the absence of non-aqueous phases its movement is not retarded in porous media (Wilson and Mackay 1993 1996; Gamlin et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2008). It has been used as a tracer for mixing and gas exchange for decades in a number of settings including lakes rivers and the open ocean (e.g. Wanninkhof 1985 1987; Ledwell et al. 1986; Clark et al. 1996; Schladow and Clark 2008; Schmieder et al. 2008; MacInyre et al. 2009). More recently SF6 has been used successfully in groundwater studies in California (Orange LA and Ventura Counties) that traced the movement of artificially recharged water through groundwater systems (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2008) and mine pit water into Clear Lake (Schladow and Clark 2008). In all cases permission was requested and granted by the Department of Public Health to use SF6 as a tracer in these potable supply aquifers. There are a number of advantages of using SF6 as a tracer of artificial recharge. First SF6 is more economical than most other tracers (such as Br- and Rhodamine dye) and hence more water can be tagged decreasing the probability that the tracers will pass wells undetected. Second it does not change the density of the tagged water thus buoyancy effects do not complicate the interpretation of the experimental results (e.g. Istok and Humphrey 1995). Third SF6 does not degrade the quality of the water; it causes no known adverse health effects (Lester and Greenberg 1950). Forth because it is a gas SF6 can be removed from water easily by aeration. In fact any SF6 that is discharged in to the bay will be lost to the atmosphere within a few weeks.,2012,2013

It has been determined that the Rochford mining district which lies just to the south of the Homestake district is a promising new prospect for exploration. This area has been selected by Great Lakes Exploration due to 1) USGS maps reporting significantly anomalous gold values 2) similarity of mineralization to the Homestake mine and 3) the relative lack of mining claims throughout the district. Great Lakes Exploration has expressed a need for a more detailed geologic understanding of the Rochford area in order to continue their exploration and this proposal outlines the goals specific types of work research plan and anticipated results that we will aim for throughout the next two years. We propose to undertake an integrated geologic framework study with the goal of providing Great Lakes Exploration with a more comprehensive understanding of the stratigraphy mineralization and structural controls for the Rochford and surrounding areas. Our focus will be mainly on mapping the Rochford area geology focusing on iron formation trends and structural features with a focus on identifying structural controls or influence on the gold occurrences. Our overriding objective is to gain a better understanding of the geologic framework of the Rochford area with the expectation that this understanding will clarify why the anomalous gold occurrences appear where they do including how and when the mineralization occurred and how much subsequent structural disruption there has been. We believe that this type of geologic framework study will significantly aid efforts to find any potentially economically valuable targets in the area and help guide efforts to extend these studies throughout the region.,2013,2015

Ralph Archuleta,2/1/13,1/31/15,"$25,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,SCEC4 ,Participation Project H: Incorporating Roughness and Supershear in UCSB Broadband Modeling,A puzzling observation of recorded borehole ground motion at very close hypocentral distances from faults reveal a great deal of incoherency in high frequency (HF) seismograms from direct body waves. Because of their arrivals and the closeness of the recording station to the fault one can deduce that the level of scattering of these waves is not that meaningful. Scattering increases in a diffusive way with distance and travel time (Zeng et al. 1990) making it difficult for CODA to show up at such short distances. Therefore a plausible assumption is that there must be complexity at the rupture fronts of earthquakes for very small scales (Gusev 2012). With these important observations it is necessary to study in detail the rupture front complexity and to answer the question: Is the rupture front continuous and smooth across the fault? If we find that rupture front is not smooth or continuous across the fault then a natural follow up question would be how will this complexity at smaller scales affect ground motion intensity measures (GMI‚Äôs) such as PGA PGV and Arias Intensity? If we find that the rupture front is not continuous or smooth then the effect of the irregularity in the rupture front must be included into current kinematic ground motion simulation techniques such as Schmedes et al. (SAL 2010).,2013,2015

The prevailing paradigm for river restoration within central California and specifically within the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program is that establishment of a naturalized self-regulating alluvial river channel connected to its floodplain will produce a cascade of benefits through the re- establishment of spawning and rearing conditions initially for salmon and coincidentally for the successful development of a number of other native aquatic riparian and floodplain organisms. Based upon decades of study by the community of aquatic ecologists and river restoration professionals in California summarized in both the scientific literature and in various resource assessments and baseline survey reports [e.g. Stillwater Sciences 2001 2002; Trush et al. 2000] it has been proposed that a self-regulating alluvial river supporting a diversity and abundance of native species including salmonids has the following components: Unconstrained banks that allow the river channel to migrate laterally to create maintain and rejuvenate pools (rearing habitat) point bars (shallow margin rearing habitat) riffles (spawning habitat) and floodplains (riparian and terrestrial habitat). A gravel-bottomed river that is mobilized and redeposited frequently enough to destroy create and maintain sufficient spawning and rearing habitat. Temporal patterns of flow conditions sediment loads water quality and water temperatures that favor the long-term survival of numerous native species whose life cycles are adjusted to these variations. This conceptual framework constitutes the richest and most thoroughly elaborated paradigm available to river restoration professionals for re-establishing the linkages between what was formerly a dynamic physical environment and the biogeochemical and biological processes that yielded the biodiversity and productivity which are now diminished. However it is essentially a qualitative model conceptualized through comparative studies and informal observations in several rivers. We are not aware of any published quantitative study of the process linkages underlying this broad conceptual model. a fact that hinders its application to planning design and assessment of restoration projects. Now that some examples of the paradigm have been implemented it is possible to use them to: refine and elaborate some of the original design concepts answer questions about the desired biological responses by expanding studies of fish invertebrates and plants quantify the strengths of the hypothesized linkages between abiotic and biotic processes as the river systems evolve after restoration quantify how the reach-scale changes operate within the larger river systems in which they are nested. The project utilizes a ~5 km long reach of the Merced River as an outdoor natural-scale laboratory in which to observe model and test hypotheses about the linkages between geomorphic and hydrologic conditions and processes and the creation and maintenance of biological habitat.,2006,2013

The majority of submerged arctic permafrost (>80%) lies in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) where studies in recent years indicate strong and widespread seep bubble ebullition from the vast permafrost deposits underlying this shallow Arctic seas estimated to sequester 1400 x 109 tons carbon primarily in the form of methane. However methane budgets are currently poorly quantified particularly the direct bubble flux; which for such shallow water can be the dominant emission mechanism. Seepage varies significantly on a range of time scales with transient emissions potentially important thus a long-term monitoring capability is critical but currently unavailable. Hence we propose a pilot study to develop and Arctic deploy a mooring to measure critical oceanographic bubble and bubble plume parameters related to seabed dissolved and ebullition emissions. In this study we will integrate instrumentation (custom-developed and off-the shelf previously Arctic- deployed) into an adaptive (smart) long-term Arctic-capable mooring package. We also will map areas of the ESAS for bubble fluxes. Instrumentation will measure: bubble fluxes with active (multibeam scanning sonar). The key acoustic approaches are innovative technological outgrowths of prior NURP-funded research. UCSB pioneered using single-beam sonar to characterize bubble fluxes supported under a previous NURP study and now is adapting state-of-the-art multibeam sonar to quantify bubble flux. Multibeam sonar is critical to reliable flux calibration. Arctic mooring deployment was during a Laptev Sea research cruise during year 1 for a period of half a day. Prior to deployment multibeam sonar and geochemical surveys will characterize site areas. Year 2 will involve multibeam sonar mapping efforts.,2010,2014

We propose to convene a scoping workshop of approximately 25 experts in the ecology and conservation of coastal temperate rainforests transboundary conservation and conservation area design. The group will begin to frame an agenda for using existing and new understanding from the natural physical and social sciences to sustain conservation outcomes for coastal temperate rainforest in a period of rapid environmental and societal change.,2009,2010

For the restoration of streams and their watersheds successful implementation also requires clear recognition of the contextual framework in which the degradation is occurring so that tools and ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù from prior efforts can be applied but only where appropriate; and a realistic understanding of what restoration outcomes are feasible given both watershed context and preexisting social and economic constraints. ‚ÄúStream restoration‚Äù is thus a complex and multi-dimensional enterprise and so there should be little surprise that examples of successful stream restoration are few. Practitioners typically embark on project analysis with a limited geographical and thematic scope thus inviting treatment of local symptoms of degradation rather than underlying causes; using a static body of knowledge without application of the most current scientific findings and engineering approaches; and bringing a narrow geographic range of practice which encourages the application of tools developed in one hydro-geo-eco-climatic region that may be completely inappropriate in another. Project design is similarly crippled by an overly narrow set of outdated and potentially inappropriate tools and techniques. Finally the articulated expectations of stream restoration are typically burdened with platitudes about lofty desired outcomes that have little or no chance of ever being achieved by virtue of either legacy disturbances left uncorrected overly limited scope of actions or simply inadequate technical and financial resources. The explicit intent of this effort is to enhance individual and institutional stream restoration capacity and capability focus on the public the national community of public and private practitioners. The following proposal is offered in support of the overall EMRRP effort as well as a means to promote improved understanding of the impacts of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems for the myriad federal state and local agencies tasked with protecting or restoring those resources.,2012,2014
Jordan Clark,7/1/08,6/30/10,"$59,487 ",UC Center for Water Resources,UC-wide,WR1028,35S The Ideal Tracer of Travel Time Near Mar Operations,In the western United States and other regions where water is limited the efficient management of this vital resource is critical. The projected growth in population combined with uncertainties associated with a changing climate is producing unprecedented stresses on water supply systems already stretched to their limits. In addition to conservation new solutions are needed to meet the future water demands in these areas. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a recent advancement in groundwater/surface water management aimed at augmenting water supplies. This practice consists of recharging imported surplus runoff and reclaimed (recycled) wastewater into aquifers for storage and later extraction. Because reclaimed water is low quality and likely to become a larger portion of recharge water in the near future it is of the utmost importance to understand the fate and transport of potential contaminants introduced into the aquifer so that appropriate and cost-effective regulations can be developed to ensure a safe potable water supply. In California draft regulations specify that groundwater supply wells must be more than 150 m (500 ft) from MAR facilities unless the water agency can document with a tracer experiment that the travel time is greater than six months. These rules demonstrate the importance of direct methods for determining travel times over the period of days to a year near MAR operations. The goal of the project is to examine the feasibility of using radio-sulfur 35S as a groundwater dating tool. The advantages of this tracer include: 1) with a half life of 87.4 days this radioactive clock is best suited for determining travel times of weeks to one year the appropriate time scale for MAR operations 2) it is naturally occurs in the environment and thus it is recharged continuously with the source water and 3) this tracer should image preferential flow paths in recharge areas. Because 35S is naturally occurring there is no cost associated with ‚Äútagging‚Äù the source water nor is there the need to have regulatory approval. Results from 35S should be comparable to deliberate tracer experiments such as those pioneered by the PI using dissolved gas tracers. The disadvantage of 35S is that the natural cosmogenic production rate is very low. 35S enters the water cycle as dissolved SO4 and because the mean life of continental SO4 is longer than the half life atmospheric SO4 rich in 35S is diluted in continental waters with 35S-dead SO4. We anticipate that 35S will be delivered to MAR operations primarily in surplus runoff which contains recent precipitation. Reclaimed and imported water should have relatively lower 35S activities because their relatively long transit and storage time allows for the loss of 35S by radioactive decay. Therefore this new tracer method may be best suited for studies of travel times at MAR operations that recharge surplus or storm runoff. The new methodology developed as part of this project will be tested at two large MAR operations in Southern California - the El Rio (Ventura County) and Montebello (LA) spreading grounds. These are ideal areas to test this method because at least 50% of the recharge water is derived from recent runoff and therefore the 35S activity should be relatively high.,2008,2010
Jordan Clark,10/1/10,12/31/14,"$110,875 ",WateReuse Association (Foundation),"Private agency, foundation",WRF-09-11,Development of New Tracers for Determining Travel Time Near MAR Operations,The objective of the study is to evaluate two new tracers to determine subsurface travel times near manage aquifer recharge (MAR) sites which could be used instead of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) for compliance with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reuse regulations. The tracers to be tested are boron‚Äì10 (as 10B enriched borate) and radio-sulfur (35S). Multi-tracer experiments with SF6 10B and 35S will be conducted on a variety of scales ranging from laboratory columns (travel time of minutes) to MAR operations (travel time of months) to evaluate the relative performance of the different tracers. The proposed study will address issues critical to the operation and regulation of many water reuse projects in California the United States and elsewhere around the world and will increase the available tools for evaluating travel times and hydraulic connections near MAR operations. These data are critical for understanding water quality changes that occur in the subsurface and permitting (in California). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is in the process of regulating emission of SF6. Although an exemption for research is being discussed and will probably be included the rules will require new methods for the introduction of SF6 into the recharge water that minimize its loss to the atmosphere. Furthermore the EPA has recently determined that SF6 and other greenhouse gases such as CO2 are pollutants. Future federal regulations may supersede California‚Äôs and prevent the use of this tracer at MAR locations.,2010,2014

The borehole program is highly leveraged, taking advantage of the resources of other programs and agencies 201 that are active in monitoring southern California earthquake activity. This data is made available online to the public and research community. As has been the case for many years, joint monitoring efforts continue between SCEC and the US Geological Survey and Caltech through ANSS, NSMP, and CISN, and the California Geological Survey to maintain the existing network of borehole stations. Other collaborators include the NSF funded NEES and HPWREN programs, as well as an NSF funded project to image the San Jacinto Fault zone, which has been leveraged to include the installation of additional borehole sensors along the San Jacinto. In 2012, the SCEC borehole program will continue to maintain the existing borehole stations in the southern California region, and also continue the collaborations with; the NEES program through processing and data dissemination of the SCEC borehole data; the SCEC/EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory borehole strainmeter program that includes pore pressure observations, and both weak- and strong-motion seismic monitoring in the Anza region; and the strong-motion borehole sensors being installed as part of a new NSF funded study of the San Jacinto fault zone.",2012,2015

The PBIC is currently managed at the Earth Research Institute (ERI) by Dr. Jamison Steidl with support from undergraduate student laboratory assistants from the department of geological sciences and electrical and computer engineering. The ability for SCEC to respond rapidly to a major southern California earthquake with the deployment of seismographs in the near-source region was a catalyst for the creation of the PBIC and is a critical asset of SCEC earthquake research community. This has been highlighted recently by the successful deployment of PBIC equipment in the 2010 El Mayor–Cucapah earthquake as well as the 2008 shakeout experiments along the southern San Andreas. Other PBIC successful RAMP deployments occurred in conjunction with the 2004 Parkfield and 2003 San Simeon earthquakes, as well as the four major earthquake sequences in the previous decade (1992 M6.1 Joshua Tree and M7.3 Landers, 1994 M6.7 Northridge, and 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine). The ability to conduct individual PI driven research experiments in between these major earthquake sequences using PBIC equipment is another very important asset. One of the main goals of the PBIC is to facilitate research in the earthquake community by providing readily accessible seismic monitoring stations for deployment in the southern California region. This year, as we embark on SCEC4, the Portable Instrument Center is starting to upgrade the data acquisition technology to current real-time systems, capable of integrating directly with the SCSN operations. Over the course of SCEC3, using its two newer real-time stations, the PBIC has 202 demonstrated the capability to deploy and integrate it’s stations into the regional network, providing high-quality observations that are being used for earthquake locations and shake map applications. These stations have proven to be dependable and require very little maintenance. The previous generation of SCEC portable equipment is now coming up on two decades of operations. This older equipment is no longer completely reliable or cost-effective to deploy, as it requires regular site visits and post-processing efforts. Data recovery is about 75% in the winter months and as low as 50% in the summer months due to the age of the equipment, and failure of the older SCSI hard drives in the warmer summer temperatures. This year equipment will be added to provide a third modern real-time station to be used by the SCEC community, as well as maintenance and operations of the other two currently deployed stations.",2012,2015
Ralph Archuleta,2/1/12,1/31/15,"$25,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,Y86552-D,SCEC4 Participation Project D: 1987 Superstition Hills Earthquake: A Triggered Event with a Complex Nucleation and Rupture Dynamics,The basic goals of this research are as following: 1. Dynamic rupture model for Elmore Ranch earthquake. Although the Elmore Ranch Fault (ERF) earthquake is relatively simple (most researchers have treated it as a point source) we want to construct a more comprehensive stress model for the ERF earthquake. We want to construct the initial stress on the ERF fault first using existing methods (e.g. Hauksson 1994) considering its local tectonic context and fault geometry and also taking into account the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake during the 12 hours preceding the Superstition Hills Fault (SHF) earthquake. 2. Evaluate the stress perturbation on the SHF due to the Elmore Ranch earthquake Based on the results from Step 1 as well as the location and focal information of the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake we will evaluate the stress perturbation on the main SHF. We will account for the fault geometry with great care to insure the relative accuracy of the Coulomb stress change estimates. It is obvious that the MW 6.2 ERF earthquake will have a major influence on the SHF nucleation. 3. Dynamic rupture model for Superstition Hills earthquake. We are going to combine the results from first two steps as outlined and previous research to constrain our stress model. We will take into account the heterogeneous velocity structure such as variable basement depth material property contrast across the fault as well as the non-planar feature of the fault (gradual fault strike changes segment stepover). We wish to integrate as much previous research as possible to construct our rupture dynamics model. We want to construct an initial stress field that could produce the key rupture patterns obtained from the observations. The relocated aftershock dataset gives us a chance to look at the possibility of stress transfer and triggering. The strong motion waveforms and the surface rupture measurements place strong constraints on the stress conditions in the upper kilometers which have almost no aftershocks in the double difference catalog. In particular we will analyze the stress conditions for the dynamic rupture model paying specific attention to the emergent nucleation and the partitioning of the seismic radiation into and high- and low-frequency energy.,2012,2015
Chen Ji Ralph Archuleta,2/1/13,1/31/15,"$25,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,Y86552-I,SCEC4 Participation Project I: Developing and testing Realtime finite fault inversion and ground motion prediction algorithms using ShakeOut synthetic datasets,The Great Southern California Shake-Out (www.shakeout.org) is a NEHRP-coordinated multihazard response exercise based on an Mw 7.8 rupture scenario of the southern San Andreas fault (Jones et al. 2008) in order to improve public awareness and readiness for the next great earthquake in southern California. Several kinematic and dynamic rupture scenarios (Graves et al. 2008; Olsen et al. 2009) had been created to artificially break a 305 km long segment of the San Andreas fault from Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea to Lake Hughes 20 km northwest of Palmdale. Multiple groups have preformed the deterministic ground motion modeling for low frequencies (<1Hz) using SCEC CVM4 velocity structure and some of results were in good agreement (Bielak et al. 2010). Graves et al. (2008) also generated the broadband (0‚Äì10 Hz) ground motion simulations which combines a 3D deterministic approach at low frequencies (<1 Hz) with a semi-stochastic approach at high frequencies (>1 Hz). Currently this unique dataset has been used yearly for the ShakeOut earthquake drill which had 8.6 million participants this year. Here we propose to use it as a benchmark to test algorithms of quick finite fault inversion and ground motion prediction. We propose to address the following questions: 1) How quick can we determine the focal mechanism seismic moment of this scenario earthquake using the new MDC approach? 2) How quick can a finite fault source model based on current algorithm be available? 3) What is the spatial-temporal resolution using current strong motion and high rate GPS stations? 4) Can we improve the results with additional stations? If so where are their locations? Note that the previous simulations produced the waveforms at dense surface grids allowing us to address this subject without additional expensive forward calculations. 5) How well will the predicted strong ground motion be? Considering the limited waveform information used to constrain the realtime finite fault the quick solution might not be very precise. Then what is the quality of the predicted ground motion parameters such as PGV and intensity? In the end as suggested by committee efforts will focus on internally operating this realtime system in UCSB and USGS Pasadena office. We also attempt to incorporate the USGS realtime GPS data flow into the system.,2013,2015
Jean Carlson Ralph Archuleta,2/1/12,1/31/15,"$34,000 ",University of Southern California,Institutes of higher education,Y86552-J,SCEC4 Participation Project J: Compactivity Comminution Heating and Disorder - The Physics of Granular Fault Gouge,We plan to apply our statistical-thermodynamic theory of granular systems ‚Äì the Shear Transformation Zone (STZ) theory of local plastic rearrangements to recent laboratory experiments molecular dynamics simulations and seismological observations involving granular fault gouge. Our focus is on three experimental paradigms that occur in shear flow--- compactivity comminution and thermally induced changes in material properties. Each of these is of interest to the SCEC Fault and Rock Mechanics community and each has become accessible theoretically based on advances in STZ theory made in the last year. Our goal is to provide a first- principles quantitative interpretation of the great wealth of experimental data on fault gouge that to date has been treated phenomenologically. The advantage of a physics-based approach is that it enables extrapolation from the lab to the field. In the first project we will connect our theory of granular hard-sphere systems [Lieou and Langer 2012] to the phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction-- the suppression of shear dilatancy by means of internal acoustic vibration‚Äîin steady shear flows which was recently observed in laboratory experiments [Elst Brodsky Bas and Johnson 2012]. We will examine how the STZ compactivity (which characterizes local volume fluctuations) is influenced by the shear rate and account for the apparent reduction in porosity due to acoustic vibrations generated at intermediate shear velocities. In the second project we will examine frictional weakening mechanisms associated with grain breakage. This involves augmentation of the original STZ theory to incorporate the effects of broad distributions of particle sizes and STZ transition barriers as was done recently to characterize aspects of the glass transition [Langer 2012] as well as physical mechanisms for granular fracture and wear [Mair and Abe 2011]. In geophysical applications the distribution of particle sizes may be responsible for frequency dependent response and variability in friction characteristics [Marone and Scholz 1989]. Grain breakage is expected to lead to frictional weakening and provides a significant pathway for energy dissipation that will help account for the lack of thermal heating during earthquakes. In the third project we will build on our recent work involving extensions of STZ theory that include thermally varying material properties [Elbanna and Carlson 2012]. The next phase will focus on shear banding as an additional weakening mechanism in order to model more realistically the shearing response of gouge layers at high strain rates. We will compare our results with laboratory experiments of Sone and Shimamoto [2009] that exhibit strain localization and rapid velocity weakening.,2012,2015

The Saugus is variably deformed across numerous active faults in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and its inferred age is commonly used to quantify fault slip rates. Yet because the formation is diachronous across the region and few absolute ages exist fault slip rates on many of the largest faults in Southern California are poorly constrained. Until recently the age of Saugus strata (0.2- 2 Ma) lay outside the range of applicability of existing Quaternary geochronological techniques. However with the advent of recent advances in cosmogenic nuclide burial dating (36Cl/10Be isochron dating) which is capable of precisely dating (uncertainty <5-10%) strata of this age a new opportunity exists to determine the age of these tectonically significant strata. The resulting chronology of the Saugus Formation will directly contribute to and reduce uncertainties in earthquake hazards assessments associated with the USGS Earthquake Hazard Program UCERF3 and the proposed SCEC Ventura Special Fault Study Area. The primary focus of this research is to resolve the two-fold uncertainty in the existing fault slip rate (5.9 mm/a and 12.5 mm/a) of the Oak Ridge fault (ORF) which extends for ~40 km through urbanized Ventura County. Rates are based on the inferred age of the Saugus Formation with the 2-fold range in the rate reflecting the uncertainty in the upper age of Saugus strata (200-500 ka). Funds from this grant will be used to conduct fieldwork including geologic mapping and identification of propitious sites for cosmogenic sampling of the top and the bottom of the Saugus Formation. Fieldwork will focus along a North-South transect from the across the Oak Ridge hangingwall north of Moorpark California where a thick section of Saugus strata are preserved in the Happy Campy syncline.,2012,2015

The Transverse Ranges is southern California’s version of a convergent margin and recent work between Ventura and Carpinteria has demonstrated that the Ventura Avenue Anticline (VAA) and associated Pitas Point – Ventura thrust have produced large uplift events. The amount of inferred uplift, on the order of 7-8 m per event, likely results in the production of a sizable tsunami along the Santa Barbara – Ventura County coastline, although until recently no one has looked for tsunami deposits in this region. Prior work in Carpinteria Salt Marsh has identified a potential tsunami layer and a stratigraphy suggesting the presence of subsidence events within the marsh. In this coming year, we propose two primary tasks to test whether a coseismic subsidence signal is present and provide more support for a tsunami origin for the deposits. First, we will need to create a metric within Carpinteria Salt Marsh to test for sudden subsidence events. This will be done by conducting a survey of modern microfossils (foraminifera and diatoms) in order to establish transfer functions for high-resolution sea-level index points to be used to quantify subsidence. Second, we propose to duplicate this study in nearby Goleta Slough to determine if a similar record of proposed tsunami deposits is present.",2012,2016

The later objective is relevant to the unusual behavior of TBA observed following the ~9 month long ethanol injection experiment of Mackay et al. (2006). As part of the diffusive exchange experiment we will also determine if trapped air exists within the aquifer.

Frank Davis David Stoms,12/11/08,11/26/10,"$269,434 ",American Petroleum Institute,"Private agency, foundation",,Biofuels and Biodiversity in California,Rising environmental economic and political concerns about the production and use of fossil fuels have led to a renewed interest in biofuels derived from dedicated energy crops or crop residues nationally and particularly in California (California Biomass Collaborative 2006). Fuel crop production also provides an economic opportunity for some farmers. A number of recent studies found encouraging evidence that the substitution of biofuels for fossil fuels could in many cases reduce environmental impacts such as eutrophication acidification and ecotoxicity and most importantly anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Sheehan et al. 2003 de Oliveira et al. 2005 Kim and Dale 2005 Hill et al. 2006 Tilman et al. 2006iHH). Little attention has been paid however to the potential impacts of fuel crop production on habitat and biodiversity. The impacts may not necessarily be negative however. For example planting perennial crops like switchgrass on idle cropland may improve habitat quality for some species (Perlack et al. 2005). Recent work by Tilman et al. (2006) showed that degraded agricultural land that was planted with a mixture of grassland perennials could produce more energy with superior reductions of GHGs without impacting food supply or native ecosystems. We could expect the biodiversity value of such restored lands would also increase. Some energy crop types are salt- tolerant and could help restore habitat quality by remediating high-salinity soils and associated pollution of wetlands in arid regions (BanÃÉuelos 2006 California Biomass Collaborative 2006). Before policy makers and business leaders commit heavily to large-scale production of biofuels the discussion needs to be informed about the potential impacts on biodiversity (Hanegraaf et al. 1998 Chan et al. 2004). For the current proposal we will conduct a statewide study of the potential effects on habitat of wildlife species associated with changes in crops crop patterns and agricultural practices under several scenarios of biofuels production. California has a modest demand for biofuel but demand is expected to increase rapidly especially with recent state policies. California requires a blend rate of 5.7% ethanol with fossil fuel in vehicles. It is also possible for vehicles to use blend rates of 10% and 20%. Current annual usage of ethanol is approximately 1 billion gallons with another 4 millions gallons of biodiesel (California Biomass Collaborative 2006). Currently California imports more than 95 percent of the biofuels used in-state (California Energy Commission 2007). The Governor‚Äôs Executive Order S-06-06 sets goals for increasing reliance on in-state production of biofuels specifically that California should produce at least 20 percent of the biofuels consumed in the state by 2010 40 percent by 2020 and 75% by 2050. The following tables indicate how those goals translate into gallons per year of production and estimates for area required to produce that volume if feedstocks were grown instate. These tables illustrate that hundreds of thousands of acres would need to be dedicated to producing biofuel feedstocks to meet even the short-term goal for 2010 at the low blend rates for both ethanol and biodiesel increasing to millions of acres by 2050 for all blend rates. Because of differences in energy efficiencies crop types have different land requirements. For instance only about half the area is required by sugar beets to meet the goals compared to corn. If corn stover can be feasibly and economically converted to ethanol along with conversion of the grain the land requirements for corn become comparable to those for sugar beets.,2008,2010
Jordan Clark,5/21/08,4/30/09,"$28,636 ",Inland Empire Utilities Agency,"California state, municipal agencies",,Chino Basin Tracer Study,The Chino Basin Tracer Study is intended to directly determine groundwater transit times from the Brooks spreading ponds to selected monitoring and production wells. It will be conducted in conjunction with the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA). The specific goals of this study are: I) Inject sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and enriched boric acid tracers and quantify their concentrations in the spreading pond over a period of three weeks. II) Travel times of the tracer will be determined by sampling groundwater at production and monitoring wells. The methodology to be used during the proposed tracer study is very simple and was developed by Dr. Jordan Clark at UCSB. It has been used previously in Orange County LA County and Ventura County (Gamlin et al. 2001; Clark et al. 2004 2005; Avisar and Clark 2005; McDermott et al. 2006). During the initial phase of the proposed project SF6 and 10B- enriched boric acid (as a borate solution) will be injected into the percolating surface water and groundwater samples will be collected at the three nearby monitoring wells (MW-A MW-H and BRK-1). During the second phase water samples will be collected at selected wells and analyzed for the tracer at UCSB so that travel times can be determined. The tracer injection will begin at least two week after the initiation of the artificial recharge. In addition to minimizing the loss of gas that may occur during the transit through the unsaturated zone the postponement of the start of the tracer experiment will allow gradients (and flow) typical of artificial recharge conditions to set up. The tracer will be injected into the spreading ponds by bubbling following the procedure developed for the El Rio (Ventura county) and Montebello Forebay (LA county) tracer experiments. Because it is vital to know the initial conditions of the recharge water SF6 and boron isotope surveys in the spreading basin will be conducted every 3 to 4 days during the injection. Each survey will consist of collecting about 10 samples evenly distributed throughout the spreading area. More than 50 SF6 samples will be analyzed during the initial phase of the proposed project. Only a sub-set (approximately 10) of the samples which will be determined based on the SF6 data will be analyzed for boron isotopes. The SF6 samples will be analyzed using the Wanninkhof et al. (1987) head space method modified by Clark et al (2004). In the field pre-weighed 10 ml VacutainerTM will be partially filled (about 7 ml of water). These containers will be sent to UCSB where they will be weighed (to determine the sample size) and carefully filled with ultra-high purity nitrogen gas (so that the final pressure is equal to 1 atmosphere). After 1 minute of shaking to equilibrate the nitrogen gas with the water sample the head space gas will be injected through a column of Mg(ClO4)2 (to remove water vapor) into a small sample loop of known volume (about 1 ml). Subsequently the gas in the sample loop will be flushed into a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector with ultra-high purity nitrogen carrier gas. SF6 will be separated from other gases with a molecular sieve 5a column held at room temperature. The detector response is determined by running gas standards purchased from Scott-Marrin Inc. Error on duplicate measurements is typically less than ¬±10%. Laboratory experiments have shown that SF6 samples can be stored for at least 6 months without appreciable lost of SF6 in VacutainerTM. The boron isotope ratios will be determined at UCSB on an ICP-MS following the procedure outlined by GaÃàbler and Bahr (1999). To minimize the background a teflon spray chamber and quartz injector will be utilized. The typical analytical uncertainty with this method is less than ¬±0.5%. The system will be calibrated using the National Bureau of Standards Reference Material NBS-951 for boron isotopes.,2008,2009
