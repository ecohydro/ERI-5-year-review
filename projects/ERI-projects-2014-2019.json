C. Mack & D'Antonio 1998). Invasive species are estimated to cost $120 billion annually in management and mitigation costs in the US (Pimentel et al. 2000; Pimentel Zuniga and Morrison 2005) making this a salient issue for land and wildlife managers. Despite this little is known about how to frame the management of invasive species in a way that facilitates public support. Prospect theory would suggest that the public will respond more strongly to frames that communicate possible losses from invasive species. Further invasive species impacts are an example of an environmental problem that has not become politicized thereby providing a useful test of prospect theory in the environmental arena where costs are often concentrated and benefits diffuse (Leung et al. 2002; Finnoff et al. 2007). Invasive species cover a range of species and human perception of them may interact with how the public perceives the potential gains or losses from the presence of the species. Prospect theory can provide important insights to how the public perceives the risks of invasive species and whether this perceived risk is consistent across species. The primary objective of this project is to assess how prospect theory applies to environmental problems that are not yet politicized. Additionally this project has practical implications for how managers can frame and message about invasive species to garner public support for management. To test the role of prospect theory in invasive species management an online panel survey will be conducted with a two by two factorial design measuring levels of support for invasive species management when it is framed in terms of the ecological or economic risks associated with the gains or losses of management. A single survey will be conducted for each species for a total of four surveys conducted. The results will be pooled once all surveys are conducted.

We first investigate the co-seismic moment rate distribution using strong motion records with the multiple double-couple (MDC) approach discussed above. We assume each potential fault segments as one double-couple point source and invert for its seismic moment centroid location centroid time and rupture duration for each fault segment using teleseismic and far-field strong motion waveforms.

When the causative fault segments are constrained we conduct finite fault inversion on a fault geometry with predefined fault segments using broadband seismic data as we did for 2008 Wenchuan and 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes.

The physics of earthquake ruptures is a complex phenomenon involving the constitutive law for sliding friction (with many different processes e.g. temperature pressure slip and slip rate affecting the friction) along with a medium that may behave elastically or plastically. The fault itself has an inherent roughness at all scales. There is simply too few data by which one can constrain the physics of an earthquake rupture. The earthquake rupture being complex produces a complex radiated field which is poorly sampled by the arrays of seismic instruments. Because one cannot directly observe an earthquake  the complex evolution of slip on a fault which is buried within the Earth to depths of 100s of kilometers  a primary question is what data can constrain the numerical models? Thus the participants in the workshop will be considering both forward modeling of earthquakes and inversion methods by which properties of the earthquake source are inferred. The approaches are complementary; both depend on the elastic and attenuation properties of the Earth. Because of uncertainties in the properties of the Earth as well as the spatial-temporal distribution of stresses on the fault there are tradeoffs between what is considered a property of the source and what is a property of the Earth. The discussion in a focused workshop allows those who have experience with these problems to discuss how the different methods might lead to better constraints on the source and propagation. This would lead to better numerical simulations and hence more realistic ground motion estimates from future earthquakes.

Without direct measurements of the fault during an earthquake the spatio-temporal evolution of the slip on the fault must be inferred from seismic geodetic and geologic observations. While the representation theorem provides the link between the spatio-temporal evolution and the observations the inverse problem has been a quagmire. The number of parameters needed to infer the details of a rupture is much larger than the number of available data i.e. the inverse problem is underdetermined. By itself that is a problem. When coupled with the fact that the temporal variables (rise time and rupture time) are not linearly related to the observations additional complexities arise in the methods for inverting the observations. Nonetheless models of the spatio-temporal evolution of slip i.e. the source process can be found. The quality of these models needs to be quantitatively assessed. High-frequency seismic data exists but has not been fully exploited. These data provide important constraints on stress drops and variations in rupture velocity. By using these data in concert with low-frequency seismograms GPS and InSAR the resulting kinematic models will be better resolved and more robust. Two methods are proposed for exploiting the high-frequency data. First using back projection areas on the fault that produce high-frequency radiation are identified. Using a multiscale inversion the parameters are resolved on a finer scale and used as constraints on the inversion at a larger scale. Second derivatives of the acceleration envelope function are inverted to determine regions of high-frequency radiation. These regions will also be subject to multi-scale inversion to constrain the overall inversions. In combination the two methods will improve the resolution and robustness of the inverted rupture model.

In the current UCSB broadband simulation method (Schmedes et al. 2013; Crempien and Archuleta 2016) there is an explicit constraint: the final moment-rate spectrum should approximate an Aki-Brune single corner spectrum that has an a priori corner based on an assumed stress drop. (The temporal parameters related to the rupture time and the slip-rate functions of each subfault are continuously adjusted in an inner loop until the spectrum of source moment-rate function approximates a specified Aki-Brune spectrum.) As shown by the Allmann and Shearer (2009) spectrum this will lead to underestimation of the acceleration high frequency spectral level. The first priority is to replace the single corner spectrum with a double corner spectrum based on Ji and Archuleta (2018). 2. While we will continue to use spatial correlation for slip (???2) we will replace the regions of high correlation with crack-like asperities (Boatwright 1988). These regions will still produce slip with ???2wavenumber and thus ???2 spectral decay (Herrero and Bernard 1994). This is similar to what is done by Irikura and Miyake (2011). However the location of the asperities will be randomly selected through the von Karman spatial correlation pattern which itself is randomly generated with a given correlation length (Mai and Beroza 2002). 3. We will explore how the asperities will fail in time. Initially we will be guided by the work of Das and Kostrov (1983 1985) Fukuyama and Madariaga (2000) and Dunham et al. (2003).

One of the most critical factors affecting ground motion is attenuation both regional and site specific. To our knowledge there have been no systematic attempts to determine the attenuation parameterized by ? (explained in the next paragraph) in Central California (CC) a region that hosts vital infrastructure such as the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and several dams all of which are vulnerable to high-frequency ground motion (Muto 2015). The effective attenuation of seismic waves has been approximated by Futterman (1962) and Knopoff (1964) with the following equation A(rf) = exp(-\u03c0fr\/?Qeff) where r is distance away from the fault f is frequency Qeff is effective seismic quality factor of S-waves and ? is S-wave velocity of the medium. There are many causes for seismic attenuation of waves but the two main recognized physical processes of attenuation have been pointed out to be anelasticity (Qin) and scattering (Qscat) (Dainty 1981) where the effective attenuation can be written as 1\/Qeff = 1\/Qin +1\/Qscat. This relationship shows the difficulty in determining the relative contributions of anelasticity and scattering to the effective attenuation. In spite of this difficulty it has long been recognized that Qscat is frequency dependent (e.g. Jin et al. 1994). If the contribution of scattering to effective attenuation is significant then Qeff should also be frequency dependent. Cormier (1982) proposed a model for attenuation based on the integration along a ray path such that A(f) = A0exp(-\u03c0tf) with t = \u222bpath dr\/(?Qeff). As the waves come to the surface the waves experience a major increase in t an argument that inspired Anderson and Hough (1984) to propose a model based on a linear decrease of the log-amplitudes of the Fourier amplitude Spectrum (FAS) of ground motion. They called the slope of this decay ? such that A(f) = A0exp(-\u03c0?f) which implies that Qeff is frequency independent. They also concluded that ? increases with distance away from the fault which is interpreted as the regional anelastic attenuation modeled as ?(r)= ?0 + mr where ?0 is the intercept of ? at zero distance and m is the slope of ?(r) as a function of distance.

Steady propagation will allow us to examine the relationship between the width of the plastically deforming zone surrounding the fault and the constant width of the slip pulse. Because steady propagation does not emit radiated energy accurate bounds can be placed in this case on the energy dissipated in the inelastic and frictional processes. Steady propagation will also allow us to investigate in a more systematic way the effect of perturbations in the material properties material response and prestress on the rupture dynamics including variability in rupture speed maximum slip rate and ultimately rupture arrest.

This is relevant for developing physically-based models for ground motion prediction. The project will accomplish the following tasks: a. Quantify the magnitude of on- and off-fault dissipation and their relative contribution to the earthquake energy budget for different friction laws (rate and state law\/slip weakening law). b.

We want to construct the initial stress on the ERF fault first using existing methods (e.g. Hauksson 1994) considering its local tectonic context and fault geometry and also taking into account the aftershock sequence of the ERF earthquake during the 12 hours preceding the Superstition Hills Fault (SHF) earthquake. 2.

Scattering increases in a diffusive way with distance and travel time (Zeng et al. 1990) making it difficult for CODA to show up at such short distances. Therefore a plausible assumption is that there must be complexity at the rupture fronts of earthquakes for very small scales (Gusev 2012). With these important observations it is necessary to study in detail the rupture front complexity and to answer the question: Is the rupture front continuous and smooth across the fault? If we find that rupture front is not smooth or continuous across the fault then a natural follow up question would be how will this complexity at smaller scales affect ground motion intensity measures (GMIs) such as PGA PGV and Arias Intensity? If we find that the rupture front is not continuous or smooth then the effect of the irregularity in the rupture front must be included into current kinematic ground motion simulation techniques such as Schmedes et al.

Information that can improve early season decision-making therefore benefits a wide range of end-users. In the Western U.S. where snow accounts for a large fraction of the annual water budget one of the largest sources of uncertainty in subseasonal to seasonal water forecasts is snowpack. The NOAA National Water Model (NWM) includes a subseasonal (30-day aka \"long-range\") forecasting module which predicts precipitation snowpack water storage and release and streamflow. This particular NWM product is currently underutilized by water managers and resource planners in part due to unfamiliarity with the system high uncertainties in the estimates and lack of grounding in the observational datasets commonly used by managers. We propose to address these current deficiencies by assimilating a new near-real-time suite of remote-sensing-based snow products into the NWM. The foundation of our methodology is a post-processing algorithm developed by NSIDC to create daily spatially and temporally consistent estimates of fractional snow-covered area clean snow albedo and dust radiative forcing products which perform better than traditional MODIS snow products. UCSB will expand this product suite in high-priority target regions with near-real-time snow water equivalent (SWE estimates derived by a novel machine-learning algorithm trained on the NSIDC remote-sensing suite and a historical SWE reconstruction model. To bring this rich data suite into the NWM NCAR has devised an ensemble particle-filter assimilation method to winnow the long-range forecast ensemble set to \"optimal\" combinations of model parameters and forecasts that best replicate the snow observations. To test the new framework the team will conduct a system-level demonstration of the NWM long-range forecast configuration for the 2018-2019 period with weekly regional snow state and parameter updates including full computational benchmarking and feasibility assessment for U.S.-wide implementation. The long-range configuration is ideally suited for our data-model fusion approach. Its simpler process representation and faster computational speeds allow parameter and forcing ensembles to become computationally tractable permitting seamless assimilation of high-quality high-impact observations like the NSIDC snow suite. With modest effort we believe this expanded system will make substantial improvements in the accuracy and relevance of the NWM seasonal forecasts to water resource managers.

The Reserve is located at the wildland urban interface (WUI) between the resort Town of Mammoth Lakes and the Inyo National Forest. Wildfire has been suppressed on the Reserve for approximately 150 years. Historical records show that average fire recurrence intervals before that time at the Valentine Reserve were as frequent as 15 years. Very high loading of fuel has accumulated and the forest is in a very unhealthy condition with excessive stand density (up to 900 stems\/acre). We propose a hazardous fuels reduction project on 50 acres of high-density forest within the reserve to increase the health and resilience of the forest and to reduce potential future wildfire severity and protect developed infrastructure in the Town of Mammoth Lakes CA. Having a large natural forest preserve in such proximity to a tourist-based semi-urban community requires special attention to both the work prescribed and the methods employed for performing the work. The WUI at Valentine Reserve will require a mixture of approaches in order to achieve fuels reduction goals oriented around preservation conservation and wildfire safety. This includes the establishing of sustainable tree spacing the maintenance and preservation of a diversity of tree age and tree species and a sensitivity to wildlife habitat. This project will incorporate forest treatment prescriptions oriented around the following: selective thinning of small conifer trees by hand felling; selective removal of dead trees; removal of trees infested with bark beetles; pole saw work (raising) in some densely forested areas in order to reduce ladder fuels; and finally some raking in areas of excessive ground fuel accumulation. Treatment of the fuels material will likely be a mixture of on-site chipping complete removal to be processed and chipped at a remote green-waste facility and some minimal piling and burning. A variety of equipment types will be used in order to move the material out of the area. A minimal impact approach on the landscape will be followed as much as practical and possible throughout the project. Finally all commercially viable and useable material will be removed and processed locally for either firewood or building material.

Stream restoration is thus a complex and multi-dimensional enterprise and so there should be little surprise that examples of successful stream restoration are few. Practitioners typically embark on project analysis with a limited geographical and thematic scope thus inviting treatment of local symptoms of degradation rather than underlying causes; using a static body of knowledge without application of the most current scientific findings and engineering approaches; and bringing a narrow geographic range of practice which encourages the application of tools developed in one hydro-geo-eco-climatic region that may be completely inappropriate in another. Project design is similarly crippled by an overly narrow set of outdated and potentially inappropriate tools and techniques. Finally the articulated expectations of stream restoration are typically burdened with platitudes about lofty desired outcomes that have little or no chance of ever being achieved by virtue of either legacy disturbances left uncorrected overly limited scope of actions or simply inadequate technical and financial resources.

This research attempts to understand how Himalayan rates of erosion vary as a function of space and time and what drives such changes. Some detrital cooling-age data suggest that irrespective of how spatially irregular erosion may be at short time scales erosion rates become much steadier at longer time scales. This research will test that contention. The PIs hypothesize that at decadal to millennial scales spatial variations in rainfall distributions modulate differences in erosion rates. Specific stream power (the product of discharge and channel gradient) is hypothesized to provide a reliable proxy for modern erosion rates. To underpin tests of these hypotheses the PIs have developed and calibrated the highest resolution remotely sensed data on rainfall currently available for the Himalaya. When combined with digital topography rainfall is routed through the Himalayan landscape and predicts pronounced along-strike variations in stream power. To test whether stream power successfully predicts variations in erosion rates the PIs will collect 50 detrital cosmogenic nuclide samples within 10 catchments that exhibit strong contrasts in stream power. With judicious placement of sampling sites this large new data set should also permit testing of a much-debated question: is the rate of erosion controlled by large trunk rivers or by the erosive power of much smaller catchments (<20 km2) that cover most of the landscape? In order to assess the extent to which erosion rates change at longer time scales the PIs will collect relief transects of bedrock samples in each of the CRN-sampled catchments and will measure ~100 cooling ages each for apatite zircon and muscovite representing closure temperatures of ~80\u00b0 ~200\u00b0 and ~375\u00b0C respectively. Reflecting different times and depths of cooling these ages will be analyzed using thermokinematic models to create reliable reconstructions of temporal changes in erosion rates at each of 10 catchments. Furthermore the PIs current analysis suggests that topographic relief exerts a fundamental control on the distribution of Himalayan rainfall and that valleys of large rivers guide moisture into the orogen. At time scales for which Himalayan topography and climate are constant spatial variations in rainfall stream power and hence erosion are therefore envisioned to remain steady. The Himalayas however are an active collisional orogen in which rocks advect laterally faster than they move vertically. The PIs hypothesize that topography also advects laterally especially in the rain shadow north of the Himalayan peaks where erosion rates appear lower. Moreover this advection is hypothesized to cause major re-organization of Himalayan drainages and related topography. If so new avenues for rainfall to move into the orogen will open old ones will close and as a consequence new patterns of erosion should emerge. As advection leads to stream capture and creation of new Transhimalayan rivers with greatly enhanced erosive power other trunk channels will be beheaded thereby losing power. Such changes in stream power should be expressed by changes in both erosion rates and topographic relief. The PIs propose to test these novel ideas by reconstructing changes in topographic relief using bedrock cooling ages both from their relief transects and from equal-elevation transects. Such dynamic Transhimalayan channels would stand in contrast to the persistence of rivers at the Himalayan indentor corners. Despite the challenges presented by Himalayan landscapes they provide a propitious setting: stark lateral variations exist in rainfall erosion and topography; cooling ages are almost ubiquitously reset and strong signals of differential erosion should rise above the inevitable geomorphic and tectonic noise"},{"list":30,"pis":"Douglas Burbank Bodo Bookhagen","start":"8\/1\/11","end":"7\/31\/17","amount":"$275,006","agency":"National Science Foundation","id":"1050070","title":"The Pamir Frontal Thrust System: Rates Style and Controls on Deformation","abstract":"Our goals include defining how where and at what rates shortening has been accommodated within the Pamir-Tian Shan structural corridor and exploring the extent to which erosion by an axial river modulates shortening rates on faults proximal to the river. We will focus our work along the axis of the structural corridor where we can examine a rich suite of along- strike structural variability in the style orientation and (likely) rate of deformation. The Pamir Frontal Thrust (PFT) is the leading edge of the Pamir orogen. In reality some apparently Pamir-related faults occur to the north of the PFT including nearby faults that ruptured in the 1985 M7.4 Wuqia earthquake [Feng et al. 1988]. Within the study area the PFT tends to be localized within lower Paleogene gypsum beds and it typically carries the entire Cenozoic stratigraphic succession (up to 8 km thick) in its hanging wall. Where the PFT is exposed in the Bozi Tage Range near the Kezilesu River it tends to be a low-angle thrust dipping from 0\u00b0 to 15\u00b0. Ongoing slip on the PFT is evidenced by offset talus slopes that show fresh scarps. Typically the PFT slices across the Xiyu conglomerate an upper Cenozoic time-transgressive fluvial conglomerate that ranges in age from 16 to 0 Ma within the foreland [Heermance et al. 2007] but which is less than 1.6 Ma where it has been paleomagnetically dated a few kilometers north of the PFT in the corridor [Chen et al. 2005].

Few places in the world expose volcanic and marine sedimentary sequences and large uplifted Quaternary terraces that can be used to understand the processes involved in the progressive stages of continental breakup. Because of the rapid tectonic motion in the Gulf of California rift (e.g. Umhoefer 2011) the Santa Rosalia basin is a site where the stratigraphic history and processes of rifting can be studied in detail with exceptional exposures and accessible outcrops. Furthermore the Santa Rosalia basin hosts large Cu-Mn-Co deposits that are not present elsewhere in the Gulf of California rift (Conly 2003; Conly et al. 2005 2006).

Our focus is on three experimental paradigms that occur in shear flow--- compactivity comminution and thermally induced changes in material properties. Each of these is of interest to the SCEC Fault and Rock Mechanics community and each has become accessible theoretically based on advances in STZ theory made in the last year. Our goal is to provide a first-principles quantitative interpretation of the great wealth of experimental data on fault gouge that to date has been treated phenomenologically. The advantage of a physics-based approach is that it enables extrapolation from the lab to the field. In the first project we will connect our theory of granular hard-sphere systems [Lieou and Langer 2012] to the phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction-- the suppression of shear dilatancy by means of internal acoustic vibration\u2014in steady shear flows which was recently observed in laboratory experiments [Elst Brodsky Bas and Johnson 2012]. We will examine how the STZ compactivity (which characterizes local volume fluctuations) is influenced by the shear rate and account for the apparent reduction in porosity due to acoustic vibrations generated at intermediate shear velocities. In the second project we will examine frictional weakening mechanisms associated with grain breakage. This involves augmentation of the original STZ theory to incorporate the effects of broad distributions of particle sizes and STZ transition barriers as was done recently to characterize aspects of the glass transition [Langer 2012] as well as physical mechanisms for granular fracture and wear [Mair and Abe 2011]. In geophysical applications the distribution of particle sizes may be responsible for frequency dependent response and variability in friction characteristics [Marone and Scholz 1989]. Grain breakage is expected to lead to frictional weakening and provides a significant pathway for energy dissipation that will help account for the lack of thermal heating during earthquakes. In the third project we will build on our recent work involving extensions of STZ theory that include thermally varying material properties [Elbanna and Carlson 2012]. The next phase will focus on shear banding as an additional weakening mechanism in order to model more realistically the shearing response of gouge layers at high strain rates. We will compare our results with laboratory experiments of Sone and Shimamoto [2009] that exhibit strain localization and rapid velocity weakening.

In addition to the highly seasonal summer rainfall winter precipitation is important for snowmelt and discharge in the pre-monsoon (spring) season. Runoff from snow is especially significant in the central Asian and western Himalayan regions where hundreds of millions of people reside but observation understanding and prediction of terrestrial water storage and fluxes remain poorly understood. Quantification of seasonal amounts of rain snow glacial and snowmelt waters and associated physical processes are largely unknown despite their importance to pre-monsoon and dry-season water for irrigation drinking and power generation. The main goal of this project is to advance our current understanding of climate processes on regional-to-continental scales and how they affect the water balance in the High Asia Mountains. The project focuses on multiannual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and winter western disturbances (WD) and their impacts on rainfall snow and runoff variability in High Asia. The project will focus on three specific objectives:I. Characterize and investigate multi-annual-to-decadal variations in the Indian Summer Monsoon and western disturbances and their regional impacts on the surface water budget in the High Asia Mountains. II. Examine the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water budget including changes in rainfall and snow and their relative roles in driving runoff variations in High Asia. III.

The coastal communities of SB with nearly 200000 people are particularly exposed to wildfire hazards as most of the population lives in a narrow zone between the mountains and the ocean. US-101 highway runs parallel to the coast and is the area most important evacuation route. SB Fire Department along with other agencies rely extensively on the National Weather Service (NWS) to provide accurate forecasts of wind direction and speed onset and demise of windstorms in preparing for firefighting strategies. However the current approaches are limited in scope detail and how interacting mechanisms are taken into account. To enhance capabilities and understanding an interdisciplinary team of experts in atmospheric sciences fire-weather ecosystem management remote sensing and transportation modeling propose to develop a framework that better accounts for mechanisms of downslope windstorms and fire spread regimes in order to derive probability risks of extreme hazards along this coastal region. This proposal contributes to PREEVENTS goals 1 and 2 by enhancing understanding improving capabilities for modeling and forecasting hazards and increasing resilience. The following tasks are proposed: 1) use available observations and the Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRF) at 1km resolution from 1979-present to investigate mechanisms and develop a climatology of significant downslope winds in the Santa Inez Mountains; 2) based on historical extreme events (task-1) use fire spread models (based on input from the WRF and observed fuels) assuming fire ignition in areas previously burned (validation) and in areas that presently have high density of vegetation fuels; 3) carry out fire weather risk assessment and determine the spatial probability of fire weather hazards affecting the greater SB region; and 4) use transportation models and results from 1-3 to examine evacuation strategies and improve resilience.

The new tracers were boron-10 (as 10B enriched borate) and radio-sulfur (35S). A multi-tracer experiment with the conservative anion bromide (Br-) 10B and heat was conducted at the test basin near the San Gabriel MAR operations (travel time of a few months) to evaluate the relative performance of the different tracers. This basin is managed by the Water Replenishment District of Southern California (WRD). The experiment showed that 10B and heat are not conservative during near field transport and therefore should not be used as a replacement for SF6. At two other southern California MAR facilities WRDs Rio Hondo Spreading Grounds and Orange County Water Districts Kraemer Basin time series measurements were made for 35S. The significant result of this experiment is that S should be considered as a viable replacement for SF6. This study addressed issues critical to the operation and regulation of many water reuse projects in California the United States and elsewhere around the world by increasing the available tools for evaluating travel times and hydraulic connections near MAR operations. These data are critical for understanding water quality changes that occur in the subsurface and permitting (in California). Although the California Air Resources Board (CARB) is regulating emission of SF6 a provision was included to allow for exemptions if the researchers can demonstrate a method for the introduction SF6 into the recharge water that minimize its loss to the atmosphere. A new method was developed using a membrane contactor with a closed circulation system for SF6 to achieve the CARB requirement of minimal SF6 loss.

Such strength plays a key role in shaping landscapes resisting erosive processes and modulating landslide hazards. The key factor however is not the strength of intact rock but rather the effective strength of the entire rock-mass at the surface where it interacts with climatic topographic and biotic variables. This effective strength is modulated by the development of fractures that weaken the rock mass and make it more susceptible to erosion physical and chemical weathering biologic activity or collapse. We have recently developed a methodology using both shallow seismic refraction surveys bedrock outcrops and laboratory analyses of intact samples to delineate variations in fracture density in the shallow subsurface. These new data indicate two common fracture patterns versus depth: rock that is uniformly fractured (apparently by large-scale tectonic forces); and rock with a distinct fracture gradient in an upper layer (apparently due to geomorphic fracturing processes have damaged the near-surface) that overlies a much stronger less fractured lower layer.

To accomplish this we will study erosion patterns in and around deep canyons on the Colorado Plateau in relation to channel steepness patterns and rock properties. Important to our approach is the concept that the spatial structure of short-term erosion rates in disequilibrium landscapes like the Colorado Plateau reflects the longer-term temporal history of mainstem river incision. Not only do the canyons and surrounding landscapes of the Colorado Plateau provide an excellent natural laboratory for this investigation but their study also carries significant broader impact and public education potential because of the iconic status of the Grand Canyon and the recent high profile debate over the antiquity of this dramatic landform (age estimates range from <6 Ma to >60 Ma). Despite the fundamental and long-recognized importance of lithology in landscape evolution it has received little attention in the quantitative studies of landscape evolution in recent decades. Partly this is because we have lacked the ability to quantitatively measure rock strength at the process scale and partly because until recently lacked firm theory to relate rock properties to river incision processes  limitations that can now be overcome. We address three fundamental problems of broad interest to Geologists and Geomorphologists: (1) the role of lithology in river incision and landscape evolution in general (2) how lithologic variability affects and limits our ability to interpret river incision history from study of landforms and (3) the controversial incision history of river canyons in the Colorado Plateau. The back drop to our study is the enigmatic Late Cenozoic exhumation history of the Colorado Plateau but although our results should contribute to solving this long-standing problem it is not our focus. We frame our study around three testable hypotheses concerning the fundamental controls on landscape evolution encoded in canyon landscapes and the last ~1 Myr of river incision history. Given the icon nature of the Grand Canyon and the vast number of tourists that visit the canyon each year public education is essential especially when geoscience educators use National Parks as case studies for teaching exercises. As part of this research we will pursue a geoscience education study (part of the graduate students time commitment) of the effectiveness of using field analogs to teach about geologic process and landscape evolution specifically related to canyon incision and relief generation.

The goal of our research is to better understand indiscriminate fisheries and their response to climate change using one of the largest and most dynamic indiscriminate fisheries in the world as a research testbed. The ecological and social implications of indiscriminate fisheries are particularly important for the world's poor. Major indiscriminate fisheries exist in inland freshwater systems in low-income countries where freshwater fish consumption is a very important part of nutritional security. Protein from large freshwater fisheries are of greatest importance in countries with annual GDP per capita of less than US$1000. Cambodia's freshwater fishery stands out as one of the largest contributors of animal protein to people living in poverty; major components of this fishery are indiscriminate. Here we will focus on the Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia perhaps the world's largest indiscriminate fishery. The Tonle Sap system feeds approximately 3 million people directly and provides income for millions more. The productivity of the system relies on hydrologic dynamics that interact with land use dynamics making for a complicated system that is impacted in many ways by human actions and will be vulnerable in many dimensions to climate change. As a result of recent ministerial decisions on fisheries management the Tonle Sap represents a prime example of an indiscriminate fishery as well as a model of community control and management of a freshwater fishery.

Shear sense and deformation temperatures will be characterized through both micro-structural analysis (following the methods of e.g. Hirth and Tullis (1992)) and through optical and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of crystal lattice preferred orientations (LPO) and the asymmetry of [c] and <a> axes patterns in quartz and feldspar grains (following e.g. Law et al. 1990 and Kruhl 1998). Diffraction patterns will be collected using an FEI Quanta 400 FEG scanning electron microscope coupled with a HKL Nordlys 2 EBSD camera at UCSB. Timing constraints on deformation within structures identified in the field will come from U(- Th)-Pb dating of 1) intrusive bodies that either cut or are deformed by the shear zones (Figure 3C); and 2) metamorphic monazite that can be texturally linked to pre- syn- and post-kinematic porphyroblasts (see thermobarometry and metamorphic ages sections). The distribution of deformation domains will provide important information regarding the spatial variations in fabric development during the evolution of the Greater Himalaya series-Main Central thrust system and the relative importance of distributed versus focused (e.g. shear zone) deformation. Within the context of the models proposed Hypothesis 1 predicts that deformation will be concentrated in the vicinity of the major thrust faults. Furthermore deformation temperatures attained would be expected to decrease abruptly down structural section. In contrast Hypothesis 2 predicts that deformation is pervasive throughout the rocks to be examined and that all rocks were deformed at high temperatures; any change in deformation temperature should be gradational. Thus understanding the distribution of deformation and its relative and absolute timing and duration of movement will provide a direct test of the competing models. In either case this study will provide a detailed account of structures including microstructural characteristics and vorticity both of which provide significant constraints on the structural evolution of the Himalayan front.

Sampling strategy: 50 bulk rock samples: host gneisses as well as leucosomes inside and outside of the Th-anomaly and at several of the deposits identified by Evans (1964) will be collected for further analysis during year 1 of the project. In addition 20 alluvial samples will be collected in order to make a reconnaissance assessment over a wider to assess the likely spatial extent of the deposit. Analysis will begin with detailed petrographic thin section analysis of bulk rock samples. From this it will be determined which samples contain sufficient REE-phosphates for further study (we anticipate making detailed analyses of a subset of the most appropriate 25- 30 samples over the two year period). Chemical Petrography: To characterize zoning patterns in xenotime and monazite chemical mapping by two electron microbeam instruments will be carried out. Preliminary mapping of monazite and xenotime inclusions will be done on a FEI Quanta scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a back-scattered electon detector (BSE). This will allow for the rapid location and identification of monazite and xenotime grains as well as an initial view to the internal zoning patterns. Following this initial screening x-ray maps of individual grains will be produced using a Cameca-SX100 electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA) equipped with five spectrometers to measure Y Th U La Pb and Nd zoning patterns. Distinguishing between zones of different chemical composition will be crucial for in-situ laser ablation. We expect the majority of chemical petrography to be complete by the end of year one.

A collaborative research team will model microenvironment impacts on species distribution abundance and diversity under rapid climate change for four tree species across four study sites in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges of California. This proposed research design is a novel combination of site trials distribution models and population models incorporating measured (rather than inferred) species' tolerances relevant to microenvironments at scales that vary over five orders of magnitude (30m-3000km). Analytical tools will include reciprocal transplant experiments field surveys species trait-based distribution models population models and biogeographic models of climate change. Physical models of microenvironments are linked to models of tree species occupation of microenvironments which in turn inform models of population-level responses. Climate change is simulated using Regional Earth Systems Models and statistical downscaling from global climate model simulations. Field experiments examine the response of establishment phase (seedling) dynamics the life history stage most sensitive to altered climate through transplanting protocols to lower (warmer) elevations. The frequency of fire in the landscape is projected using correlations of fire to landscape conditions under current climate.

The Saugus is variably deformed across numerous active faults in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and its inferred age is commonly used to quantify fault slip rates. Yet because the formation is diachronous across the region and few absolute ages exist fault slip rates on many of the largest faults in Southern California are poorly constrained. Until recently the age of Saugus strata (0.2- 2 Ma) lay outside the range of applicability of existing Quaternary geochronological techniques. However with the advent of recent advances in cosmogenic nuclide burial dating (36Cl\/10Be isochron dating) which is capable of precisely dating (uncertainty <5-10%) strata of this age a new opportunity exists to determine the age of these tectonically significant strata. The resulting chronology of the Saugus Formation will directly contribute to and reduce uncertainties in earthquake hazards assessments associated with the USGS Earthquake Hazard Program UCERF3 and the proposed SCEC Ventura Special Fault Study Area. The primary focus of this research is to resolve the two-fold uncertainty in the existing fault slip rate (5.9 mm\/a and 12.5 mm\/a) of the Oak Ridge fault (ORF) which extends for ~40 km through urbanized Ventura County.

In this framework our inverse model can rapidly explore alternative representations of Fe-cycling processes guided by new high-quality observations.

Operational models high uncertainty imposes costs for water users. For instance April to July runoff forecasts for the American River in Californias Sierra Nevada have a median error of 18% and sometimes exceed 100% [Dozier 2011]. Uncertainty stems from the heterogeneous nature of mountain snow. Spectral mixing techniques using satellite-based imagery in the visible and near-infrared bands have been successful at mapping snow covered area (SCA) at sub-pixel resolution [e.g. Rosenthal and Dozier 1996; Painter et al. 2009]. The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow from each pixel can be combined with a calculation of melt to reconstruct the accumulated SWE for each day back to the last significant snowfall [Martinec and Rango 1981]. Successful examples of reconstructed SWE include large basins in the Rocky Mountains [Molotch 2009] and the Sierra Nevada [Rittger 2012; Guan et al. 2013; Girotto et al. 2014]. Reconstructions main advantage lies in its provision of spatially resolved SWE estimates without the need for ground based observations but its biggest disadvantage is that SWE can only be calculated retroactively after snow disappears. Alternatively passive microwave (PM) sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several issues notably signal loss in wet snow [Chang 2000] saturation in deep snow [Kelly et al. 2003; Takala et al. 2011; Hancock et al. 2013] decreasing SWE with increasing forest fraction [Nolin 2010; Tedesco and Narvekar 2010] subpixel variability in the mountains owing to the large (~25 km) pixel size [Vander Jagt et al. 2013] and SWE overestimation in the presence of large grains such as depth and surface hoar [Derksen et al. 2005; Durand et al. 2011].

As the climate warms the timing and quantity of water from snow and glacial melt is changing. Little is known about the spatial distribution of snow over vast areas of the world. A few areas have relatively dense measurement networks or aerial snow surveys that provide estimates of basin wide snow water equivalent (SWE) which greatly aid runoff forecasts. Most mountain areas i.e. almost all of High Mountain Asia lack such measurements and therefore have nonexistent or poor runoff forecasts. Additionally there is no baseline in these areas as accurate snow measurements are not available retrospectively either. In these austere areas estimates of snow on the ground must be derived from different satellite measurements all of which suffer from limitations. We have developed a snowmelt energy balance model called the Parallel Energy Balance Model (ParBal) that is driven entirely by satellite-based measurements. ParBal is highly parallelized and optimized so that it can be run at resolutions that are an order of magnitude greater than current operational products as well as for large areas (continents) over long time periods (decades). Recently ParBal was used to build a snowpack in reverse with a technique called SWE Reconstruction. The reconstructed SWE was then validated using snow measurements from an aerial laser scanner and spectrometer in the Tuolumne Basin CA. Results show that ParBal performed better than any other method tested with no bias and very low (26%) mean absolute error (MAE) for basin-wide SWE. In contrast the operational model used by the National Weather Service The Snow Data Assimilation System overestimated SWE in every year with a 33% mean Bias and a 65% MAE. SWE Reconstruction has several limitations: it is only available retrospectively after the snow melts; it can only estimate ablation; and it is only valid for regions with little accumulation during ablation. Because of these limitations we will use reconstructed SWE as training data in machine learning techniques. We will use snow measurements that are available daily from optical- and micro-wavelength sensors aboard satellites as predictors. Machine learning allows for flexible utilization of these predictors since it is known that certain sensors are more effective in certain geographic areas and during certain times of the year. In this manner we will generate models that can be used for near real-time SWE prediction with the lags (i.e. a day or two) coming only from processing time.

Snowmelt runoff forecasting in mountainous areas such as the western United States has developed as empirical models forced by sparse in situ measurements of snow water equivalent that lie primarily in subalpine regions. Not only do the seasonal forecast models already have large errors in some years they rely on a data record that assumes stationarity and therefore are theoretically ill suited for water manage- ment in a changing climate. Moreover they are unable to accurately address water resources during extreme events such as persisting spring snow or new snowfall in the alpine zone above almost all measurement sites. In response to this need for better assessment of the snow resource in mountain areas new Earth System Data Records that use MODIS data have become available. However they have not been rigorously validated and uncertainties and the possible presence of systematic error are not known. In this investigation we propose to undertake this necessary validation through four years because the products will evolve. The specific Earth System Data Records are: Daily MODIS fractional snow cover. - MODIS fractional snow cover based on the normalized difference snow index originally developed for Landsat [Dozier 1989; Hall et al. 2006] available from Terra (product MOD10A1) since 2000 and from Aqua (product MYD10A1) since 2002 [Salomonson and Appel 2004 2006]. - MODIS fractional snow cover based on spectral mixing [Painter et al. 2009] available for the Sierra Nevada since 2000 but produced on demand for any MODIS scene. The al- gorithm will be used for the NOAA\/NOHRSC National Snow Model starting in water year 2010-11 and has been adopted for the GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sched- uled for launch in the 2015 timeframe.  Snow albedo of the fractional snow cover based on choosing the snow endmember from spectral mixing that minimizes the residual error [Painter et al. 2009]. A snow albedo prod- uct is also available for the normal binary (snow vs no-snow) snow-covered area product [Klein and Stroeve 2002] but it is usually applied to continuous snow cover.  MODIS fractional snow cover and albedo smoothed and interpolated across time and space to compensate for cloud cover off-nadir viewing and data dropouts [Dozier et al. 2008]. The analyses are available as monthly data cubes during the snow seasons for the Sierra Nevada since 2000. The coupling presented here of fractional snow cover and the albedo of that snow provides water managers with spatially and temporally dense data records that populate modeling in- puts for forecasting and research. Their use in snowmelt models and reservoir operations would be advanced by our proposed investigation which would validate the products analyze the structure of errors and advise users of caveats and likely accuracy. Of greatest interest is their potential combination with surface data and energy balance models to help estimate the -1-spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). SWE can be interpolated in near real time from snow pillow and snow course measurements constraining the surface measurements by satellite snow-cover estimates [Fassnacht et al. 2003]. In addition SWE can be reconstructed from satellite snow-cover estimates and snow-depletion models [Martinec and Rango 1981; Cline et al. 1998; Molotch 2009].

For the validation case we propose to use the Sierra Nevada of California a mountain range of extensive historical study emerging scientific innovation and conflicting priorities in managing water for agriculture urban areas hydropower recreation habitat and flood control. For the austere regional focus we will examine southwest and south Asia where some of the most persistent drought in the world causes food insecurity and combines with political instability and occasional flooding to affect US national security. Our approach will use a mix of satellite data and a spare modeling approach to present information essential for planning and decision making ranging from optimization of proposed infrastructure projects to assessment of water resources stored as snow for seasonal forecasts. We will combine optical imagery (MODIS on Terra\/Aqua VIIRS on NPP) passive microwave data (SSM\/I AMSR-E) retrospective reconstruction with energy balance calculations and gridded feed-forward uncoupled land surface modeling to establish retrospective context. Specifically we will use the period spanning the decade-long record from Terra and Aqua to bracket the historical record. In the California Sierra Nevada surface measurements have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for us to validate our approach which we will extend to the Hindu Kush of High Asia where surface data are sparse and where access presents significant difficulties. The world's mountains accumulate substantial snow and in some areas produce the bulk of the runoff. In ranges like Afghanistan's Hindu Kush availability of water resources affects US policy martial and humanitarian operations and national security. The rugged terrain makes surface measurements difficult and also affects the analysis of remotely sensed data. The analysis would leverage several techniques developed from NASA-sponsored research and use NASA instruments.

CAS has operated a glacier field station in the Tien Shan since the 1958 International Geophysical Year. Several U.S. scientists have worked in the region and published findings that analyze Chinese data. A face-to-face workshop allows us to fully characterize the data available learn about ongoing work on snow glaciers and hazards in High Mountain Asia and best specify how a Glacier Melt Tool will advance science worldwide. At the Kathmandu workshop participants identified a set of priority themes and began to define specific collaborations that take advantage of strengths and resources of NASA and CAS that include satellite and airborne sensing field measurements and modeling. To further these collaborations we established three working groups-- process research and modeling data sharing and exchange and validation--to begin work on a Glacier Melt Tool to support monitoring process understanding and future projections of glaciers and snow in High Mountain Asia. The two subsequent workshops--one in the U.S. and the next in Beijing--will provide more specific guidance about research needed to understand changing climate and implications of human impacts on glaciers and using Earth observations how the changing cryosphere in High Mountain Asia alters the risks of hazards and how societal impacts on communities in the region might be mitigated. The recent earthquake in the region illustrates how the combination of tremors snow and ice and avalanches has devastated villages and raises the hope--indeed the expectation--that scientific and technological resources of NASA and CAS could help restore Nepalese communities and lessen the consequences of future events. The September 9-11 2015 workshop at Mammoth Mountain California will consist of a few keynote talks invited presentations that build on the work presented in Kathmandu in January posters that illustrate relevant recent work by the attendees and their students and break-out meetings of the working groups. Invitations to attend will be extended to the participants in the January workshop along with a few others who were not able to attend that one. Because of lower costs associated with a meeting in the U.S. instead of Nepal we will encourage attendance by some advanced graduate students also. We will cap attendance at 65 participants with travel support for 31. The third meeting in Beijing to be scheduled in early 2016 will enable us to finalize all recommendations and formulate goals. At that meeting we will conclude preparation of publishable papers that lay out strategies for future research. The Chinese Academy of Sciences will host that meeting. This proposal includes travel support for 25 U.S. attendees who are not Civil Servants.

Snowfall is typically generated by the topographic lifting of moist air advected to the region by powerful winter storms. Higher elevations tend to receive more precipitation that the lowland areas due to orographic effects. To capture this spatial variability we currently use a combination of rain gauges and snow pillows. However the paucity of these stations particularly at high elevations makes the estimate of mountain precipitation error prone and hard to assess. This has large implications for the hydrologic modeling of these watersheds and therefore streamflow forecasting. In order to reduce the error around these forecasts we need alternatives to surface stations that can truly capture the spatial patterns of precipitation. Remotely sensed snow depth and water equivalent at a time scale that resolves storms could offer a truly unique answer to this problem. Even though NASAs Airborne Snow Observatorys (ASO) primary mission objective is to measure snow depth and reflectivity for streamflow forecasting it has recorded a number of storms in 2014 and 2015 and will again fly this year. This has presented a truly unique opportunity to study the spatial distribution of snowfall in the Tuolumne basin in Californias Central Sierra Nevada. Therefore I will use ASO to first investigate the spatial structure of precipitation through changes in snow depth and then use these observations to assess whether gridded precipitation products and surface station data can replicate these observed spatial patterns. Finally I will analyze the regional atmospheric circulation patterns for the individual events as this may be key to understanding the differences in snow accumulation between storms. Collection of the ASO data upfront and preliminary testing have demonstrated the feasibility of this study thus minimizing the proposal risk while also indicating the potential for considerable scientific reward. The proposed study directly supports the Water and Energy Cycle focus of NASAs Earth Science Research program and the Water Resources focus area of NASAs Applied Sciences Program. The work will provide valuable insights into to the distribution of water in mountain environments through an innovative and unique blend of NASA remotely sensed observations and models.

We used optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to measure snow grain geometry and chemical composition. Our findings agree with laboratory experiments and sintering theory. Because of the time required for sampling and microscopy we sampled in just two locations. We now plan to extend our sampling to learn how stratigraphy and sintering vary spatially. Other studies we recently published examine how spatial variability is the driving mechanism that produces power laws in avalanche depth distributions. We will use a new method near-infrared digital photography for rapid quantitative stratigraphy and to cover the range of variability over a large mountain. We will apply this technique to snow stability evaluation and the general study of snow metamorphism. Since the measurement of snow properties with near-infrared photography is a new technique it has not been widely used and there are no peer-reviewed studies that apply it to snow stability. While the heterogeneity of grain sizes at the snow surface has been investigated with remote sensing there are many fewer studies of the heterogeneity of snow properties in buried layers especially at the slope scale. Our experience extensive instrumentation site accessibility and large number of avalanche control records make our field location Mammoth Mountain an ideal site to test how near-infrared photography can be used for avalanche hazard evaluation. We will relate mechanical strength to specific signs of instability called lemons i.e. yellow flags. We propose that four of five common lemons can be identified with nearinfrared photography alone. We will also use spatial statistics and machine-learning techniques to classify stable and unstable near-infrared snow profiles. The funding requested will supply materials and travel expenses for one PhD student who is supported by an ORISE fellowship through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory.

The goal is to provide scientific information to optimize water storage quality and groundwater sustainability as precipitation varies temperatures warm and population grows. To consider the range of headwater-to-groundwater systems we focus on three river basins comprising different climatic geologic and socio-economic settings -- Shasta R (volcanic northernmost lowest and wettest) Kings R (granitic southernmost driest highest poorest) and the American R (metamorphic wealthiest). Novel methods to monitor and model ongoing and future changes in rain and snowmelt in the headwaters will be coupled with process-driven modeling and measurement of evapotranspiration groundwater recharge and withdrawal in the lowlands. Models will consider changes in water policy and infrastructure and resulting impacts on energy production and consumption. Collaboration between the campuses and Labs will build interdisciplinary teams that include faculty in all career stages who study aspects of the water cycle from remote sensing of precipitation to water policy.

Rift zones exhibit marked variability in terms of extension rate magmatism pre-existing structure and temporal evolution and initial conditions and geologic idiosyncrasies likely play a key role in rift dynamics. Therefore understanding the entire extensional system  from rift axis to flank  is critical. Our study will explore extensional deformation of mantle lithosphere and the crust: how strain varies with distance from the axis whether along-axis heterogeneity is a function of time or pre-existing conditions and how extension is accommodated at crustal versus mantle depths. This work will help us ascertain whether rifting is controlled by shallow or deeper processes with an emphasis on the location of melt and its role in modifying lithospheric strength at different depths. This project entails seismic imaging in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and Gulf of Aden (GoA) out to the rift margins. In addition to data from existing experiments since 2001 this project will utilize a new dataset collected by Keranen that extends seismic coverage of the MER to ~500 km off the rift axis. The wide aperture array is critical to constrain pre-rifted structure that may control rift dynamics as well as to image the geodynamically-crucial transitional zone between rift and flank. By comparing the incipient MER and the more mature GoA we will elucidate the time-dependency of lithospheric strain geometry. The proposed imaging comprises simultaneous inversion of P and S receiver functions with Rayleigh wave phase velocities within a Bayesian framework; this approach is ideally suited to constrain lithologic\/seismic discontinuities the presence of melt and complex 3-D rift structure. Anisotropic body wave inversions and splitting studies will help constrain the locus of melt as well as the time-integrated strain history of this rift.

This margin holds clues to the processes of continental breakup encoded in the transitional region between continent and young ocean. New broadband seismological data from a 2014-2015 amphibious seismic deployment holds promise for a more detailed analysis of the ENAM region particularly offshore where little work has thus far been carried out using the newly available data set. Preliminary research in this region revealed unexplained patterns of seismic anisotropy (a directional dependence to seismic velocity often linked to ancient flow and\/or architecture of magmatic plumbing systems) and unclear linkages between crustal thickness magnetic anomalies and deeper structure of the tectonic plates.

Because of the acute reduction in vegetation and organic matter soils burned by fire lose cohesion and infiltration capacity. Along with enhanced soil water repellency runoff and flooding potential are elevated years after fire. Post-fire hydrologic and sedimentologic responses are extremely complex varying with burn severity rainfall regimes geophysical characteristics and vegetation recovery. Although researchers have studied these processes for more than 70 years predicting post-fire effects remains elusive and physically-based models of post-fire runoff and erosion are not yet complete. Part of the difficulty is that temporal windows for observing post-fire effects are comparatively short with direct measurements tending to span only part of the recovery period (typically less than three years). Equally important are longer-term perspectives however in regards to how wildfire impacts Earth surface processes in the context of landscape evolution. Developing predictive understanding of both short- and long-term effects is critical to the future of our planet especially in an era of changing climates that have increased frequencies and magnitudes of wildfires. This proposed RAPID project focuses on production and delivery of dry ravel a characteristic and immediate post-fire response on steep slopes in the western USA. Dry ravel is a dry-season erosion process whereby gravel sediment moving down hillslopes by gravity becomes trapped by vegetation. Burning vegetation releases this sediment enabling its accumulation at margins of ephemeral channels. Dry ravel therefore provides a significant source of sediment into river channels after fire in chaparral environments. The investigators will quantify the volume of dry ravel sediment derived from the recent Springs Fire that burned Big Sycamore Canyon in southern California during May 2013 Using Terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) augmented by field surveys. Additionally the investigators have geomorphic data spanning over 25 years for Big Sycamore Canyon and two comparable basins nearby with different fire histories. Thus comparing the dry ravel processes at these three sites will enable a compelling story of both short- and long-term sediment dynamics following wildfire in chaparral environments. These data are critical toward developing models of the dynamics of dry ravel for further development and testing.

Now that much scientific publishing  especially data publishing  takes place through a database rather than conventional journals how should something that is found in a database be cited? More generally how should digital data that is stored in a repository with internal structure and which is subject to change be cited? This is the case for the very large number of curated databases through which much scientific publishing now takes place; it is also true of most scientific data collections which are seldom stable. There has recently been substantial interest in the problem of data citation and various organizations have proposed structures for the format and content of citations; however most proposals do not address issues of structure and change that are intrinsic to databases. The focus of this proposal is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the following issues: (1) the potentially very large number of possible citations; (2) citations should be both human and machine readable; and (3) citations must conform to specifications prescribed by both the publishers of the data and by the various standards that are being established. All these give rise to interesting computational challenges: citations must be generated automatically from the data; the source data must be guaranteed to support the generation of these citations; and the generated citations must be guaranteed to conform to the specifications. Of course as with any computational problem all this must be done efficiently. Citation is also closely related to provenance and issues of reproducible results. Workflows executable papers and microcitations have all been proposed to support reproducible analysis of data. The work of this project will explore the connections between these ideas and where possible establish a common framework. For many databases the publishers and authors have a clear idea of how they would like their data to be cited and there is enough information in the database to enable these citations to be generated once the right computational machinery has been developed. However interesting questions arise when a set of data to be cited is arrived at by means of a query in which case the query itself may need to be included (an actionable citation). In other cases the navigational structure needed for meaningful citation  such as in the case with linked open data or RDF which are ostensibly large amorphous graphs  may be missing. The challenge here is to find techniques for discovering or adding that structure to provide the necessary basis for citation.

Flow within a channel can range from pure Couette flow to Poiseuille flow or be a combination of the two. Couette (or linear) flow develops between rigid plates moving relative to one another and is characterized by simple shear (high vorticity number) with the highest velocities toward the top or bottom of the channel.

Poiseuille flow is characterized by high vorticity number (simple shear) at the top and bottom of the channel decreasing vorticity number (mix of simple shear and pure shear or general shear) toward the center of the channel and low vorticity number (pure shear) at the center of the channel. This project will document the deformation vorticities finite strain temperatures and timing during ductile flow combined with existing thermobarometric geochronologic and thermochronologic data will provide a comprehensive spatial thermal and temporal history of deformation and flow in middle crustal rocks southern Tibet. Furthermore our studies combined with similar published and ongoing studies in middle crustal rocks exposed in the high Himalaya will provide an unprecedented view of middle crustal flow parallel to the transport direction over a distance of 50100 km. Characterization of deformation over a broad range of spatial thermal and temporal scales is critical to testing models of middle crustal channel flow\/extrusion within a collisional orogen and will provide invaluable insight into the role of the middle crust in the geodynamic development of the HimalayanTibetaan orogenic belt and orogenic belts in general.

During subduction a series of progressive devolatilization reactions release fluid from the slab. Some of these fluids enter the overlying mantle wedge and trigger melting that in turn leads to arc volcanism. While it is clear that fluids play an important role in the dynamics of subduction zones the precise fluid pathways remain unclear. Details of the fluid budget the location of dehydration events and the precise role of fluids in triggering intermediate-depth seismicity also remain unquantified. Recent seismological work has provided important new insights into the position of intermediatedepth seismicity in the slab and the role of seismic anisotropy in the interpretation of seismic velocities. The first allows us to test whether fluids are responsible in generating intermediate-depth seismicity; the second leads to improvements in the seismological mapping of fluids and melts within the mantle wedge. The strong non-linear influence of fluids on material properties and wave propagation makes it essential to use a forward modeling approach where we predict the physical state of wedge and slab by dynamical models that take into account the best constraints from mineral physics and petrology. By comparing the seismological expression of these models with the observations we can iteratively improve the dynamical\/petrological models. In the research proposed here we will develop new high-resolution 2D\/3D finite element models of the dynamics and thermal structure of subduction zones. We will use petrological and mineral physics constraints to guide the choices for rheology and to predict the seismological expression of these models; in particular for velocity anisotropy. Using seismological modeling we will compare the predictions with observations and use an iterative approach to develop a suite of models that satisfy the observations. We will use these models to study the dynamics and structure of the subducting slab and mantle wedge at two GeoPRISMS primary sites (Alaska and Cascadia) and the well-instrumented Japan subduction system to address three main questions: 1) Does intermediate-depth seismicity indicate the presence of fluids? 2) Can we constrain the composition and deformation of the mantle wedge from observations of seismic anisotropy? 3) Can we use improved predictions for the petrological structure of the slab and anisotropic structure of the wedge to improve the locations of subduction-zone earthquakes? The focus sites are well-studied warm and cold subduction zone end-members and provide excellent testing grounds for the main research hypotheses.

Mechanisms of crustal recycling include arc subduction sediment subduction continent subduction subduction erosion and foundering. These processes dictate the rates and types of crustal chemical and physical evolution\u2014and even more-fundamental issues such as the secular evolution of continental volume\u2014but are only loosely understood. This limitation has led to a wide range of viewpoints on the efficiency of the recycling process. If for example 95% of continental crustal material that is ablated by subduction erosion is returned to the mantle [Scholl and von Huene 2007] this process reduces the global continental volume at a rate of ~1.3 km3 \/yr and the eroded material comes from all crustal levels. Alternatively if crustal material removed by subduction erosion undergoes buoyancy-driven fractionation the mafic material may return to the mantle but the felsic material may be relaminated to the base of the crust [Hacker et al.  2011; 2015]. Our understanding of crustal recycling comes chiefly from i) geodynamic models ii) large-scale box models that use specific isotopic systems to quantify recycling rates [Coltice et al.  2000; Simon and Lecuyer 2005]; iii) exposed arc rocks [Kelemen et al.  2003; Ducea et al.  2013] from which one can infer the magnitude and timescale of lower crustal foundering; iv) geophysical images of foundering material [Zandt & Carrigan 1993]; and v) xenoliths which provide snapshots of processes at depth. Among these techniques xenoliths provide our only actual samples of the physical and chemical materials and processes involved in crustal recycling and constitute our only way to verify or ground truth inferences made from geodynamic models box models exposed arcs and geophysical images. For example xenoliths provided the spectacular record of foundering of the Sierra Nevada arc lower crust and upper mantle [Ducea & Saleeby 1996; Chin et al.  2013] and the foundation for interpreting seismic velocities as images of the recycling process [Zandt & Carrigan 1993]. In spite of the tremendous insight that xenoliths afford our understanding of crustal recycling basically all xenoliths from mantle depths are mafic or ultramafic\u2014with two exceptions: one locality in the Pamir and one in Tibet. These unusual xenolith localities thus present a special opportunity to understand the chemical and physical processes that attend crustal recycling. We propose to integrate geochemical constraints from the Pamir xenoliths with geodynamic models to address the following questions: What is the timescale of recycling: how rapidly did the crust sink metamorphose and melt? How do typical continental crustal rocks reach mantle depths? What mineralogical changes occur during recycling? How do density and buoyancy evolve during recycling? Under what circumstances can part of a typical crustal section founder? To what extent does sorting occur during recycling? For example can mafic or ultramafic rocks pull felsic rocks down into the mantle? Or do the felsic rocks always manage to escape on the way down? Is crust in the process of being recycled differentiable from the surrounding mantle using seismic wavespeeds?"},{"list":102,"pis":"Brad Hacker","start":"9\/1\/18","end":"8\/31\/21","amount":"$91,110","agency":"National Science Foundation","id":"1829426","title":"Collaborative Research: Structure and dynamics of the Alaska mantle wedge","abstract":"The Alaskan subduction system is one of the planet's archetypal subduction zones and studies here are the basis of much first-order understanding of subduction dynamics.

This proposal takes advantage of these data to test fundamental hypotheses regarding subduction structure and dynamics. The proposed project integrates new seismic observations state-of-the-art wavefield simulations and petrologically consistent models of subduction-zone mantle structure to test these hypotheses. It focuses on three distinct corridors for which EarthScope and related projects provide unusually good sampling: (a) the Cook Inlet corridor where normal Pacific lithosphere subducts and the arc is robust; (b) the nearly amagmatic Denali corridor where the Yakutat oceanic plateau subducts and generates intermediate-depth earthquakes; and (c) the Wrangell Volcanic Field corridor where slab seismicity is nearly absent but there is very high-volume volcanism. Observations of seismic attenuation provide proxies for thermal structure and melt abundance and observations of shear-wave splitting constrain the anisotropic fabric and its variation between hot and cold parts of the mantle wedge.

Can we use geological observations in some particularly well-exposed suture zones to make general statements about how landscapes and sedimentary basins evolve during suturing? What geodynamic processes lead to decreases in plate convergence rate? Are Mediterranean-style rollback of remnant oceanic lithosphere and opening of marginal oceanic basins characteristic of all or most pre-climax collision zones? Do presuturing ophiolite obduction and intraoceanic arccontinental margin interactions leave predictable signatures in suture zones? How is the upper continental plate preconditioned by pre-suturing tectonism and how does the upper plate evolve during the transition from oceanic to continental subduction?

We propose to address such questions through a 4-year investigation of the archetypal IndiaAsia collision zone (IACZ) in southern Tibet that involves 19 investigators and 14 graduate students from 9 different institutions. Techniques to be employed include structural geology stratigraphy geochronology thermochronology stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry igneous and metamorphic petrology paleomagnetism and geodynamical modeling. We aim to determine the: (1) evolution of paleogeography and paleoelevation during the transition from oceanic subduction to mature continental collision; (2) geodynamic processes that caused marked decreases in IndiaAsia convergence rate; (3) role of Mediterranean-style opening and closing of marginal basins prior to terminal collision; (4) metamorphic evolution of lower-plate (Indian) rocks in response to ophiolite emplacement possible intra-oceanic arc collision and continent collision; (5) role of pre-collisional Andean-style magmatism and deformation in preconditioning the upper-plate lithosphere and how this Andean-style system evolved during continent collision; (6) paleogeography of the Neo-Tethys margins and the history of subduction exhumation thickening and underthrusting\/rollback of Greater Indian continental lithosphere; and (7) spatial pattern magnitude and history of erosion and sediment dispersal.

Both the salient and gneiss-dome suite are thought to have developed synchronously and largely since Miocene time. At depth the thick crust (\u2265 65 km) of the Pamir is underlain by a cold mantle lid interpreted to be northward underthrust Indian lithosphere; it is bound in the north by a southward-dipping zone of intermediate-depth seismicity that has been attributed to intracontinental subduction of Asian lithosphere.

These two end-member scenarios are not mutually exclusive in that they may have acted in concert or played varying roles in space and time. Nevertheless they make contrasting predictions at the scale of the entire orogen that can be assessed with geologic investigations.

Lavas erupted at the Baffin Island flood basalt province which record the initiation of Icelandic hotspot volcanism at 62 Ma host the highest know terrestrial mantle-derived 3He\/4He (50 Ra ratio to atmosphere). Mid-Miocene Icelandic lavas record the second highest 3He\/4He globally (43 Ra). Unlike the Baffin Island lavas the mid-Miocene Icelandic lavas were not emplaced through continental crust. Thus the Icelandic lavas provide the best opportunity to evaluate the radiogenic isotopic composition of the highest 3He\/4He mantle domain free of continental assimilation. A recent discovery identified large magnitude 182W anomalies in Baffin Island lavas with high 3He\/4He (\u2265 43 Ra). In the 182Hf-182W system 182Hf decays to 182W (t1\/2 = 8.9 Ma) thus all 182W\/184W heterogeneity was generated during the lifetime of 182Hf (<50 Ma after accretion). Therefore the discovery of 182W anomalies shows that early-Hadean signatures have survived for >4.5 Ga in the dynamic mantle. The preservation of Hadean 182W anomalies in the modern high 3He\/4He mantle is an exciting discovery and provides a key constraint for geodynamic models seeking to describe the time-scales over which geochemical heterogeneities are preserved in the mantle. The discovery of Hadean-generated 182W anomalies in lavas sampling the modern (62 Ma) mantle leads to several key questions regarding the 3He\/4He mantle sampled by the Icelandic hotspot: 1. Are positive 182W anomalies associated with high 3He\/4He ratios in mantle-derived lavas at other localities? 2. Does a moderately high 3He\/4He lava from Icelands neovolcanic zone which hosts a Hadean 129Xe\/130Xe signature also preserve a Hadean 182W anomaly? 3. Do 182W anomalies exhibit relationships with He Sr Nd Pb and Os isotopes? Such relationships will provide insights into the geodynamic processes that preserve 182W anomalies in the mantle.

Among the key characteristics shared by bulk continental crust and some subduction zone magmas is calc alkaline affinity a rapid draw-down in Fe concentration early in a magmas cooling history. Most hypotheses for explaining calc-alkaline differentiation from a primary magma invoke a combination of the effects of elevated H2O and oxygen fugacity (fO2) both of which are common in arc magmas on the early solid phase assemblage when arc magmas begin to crystallize. The relative importance of H2O fO2 and magmatic bulk composition in generating calc-alkaline magmas however remains an outstanding and important question. Moreover although the elevated H2O contents of arc magmas are generally thought to derive from the subducted lithosphere no such consensus has been reached for the cause of elevated fO2 in arc magmas. Contrasting models link oxidizing processes either to an oxidizing flux from the subducted plate concomitant with (though not directly caused by) the addition of H2O or to an oxidizing process in the overriding plate (e.g. crystallization degassing) through which magmas pass before eruption. Resolving the key roles that H2O fO2 and magmatic bulk composition play will have important implications for models of how Earths continents initially formed and have grown through time. Lavas of varying calc-alkaline affinity from strongly calc-alkaline to mildly tholeiitic erupt along the Aleutian arc making it an ideal natural laboratory for constraining the petrogenesis of these magma types. This study will provide critical new constraints on the fO2 of variably calcalkaline magmas in the Aleutian arc and explore how fO2 is linked to magmatic H2O contributions from the subducted plate and various differentiation processes through the combined study of melt inclusions whole-rocks and petrological experiments. To do this we will measure dissolved volatiles Fe3+\/?Fe ratios and isotopic signatures of melt inclusions and\/or whole-rocks from the Eastern and Western Aleutians and pair these natural studies with experimental constraints on the effects of H2O fO2 and bulk composition on the phase equilibria of Aleutian parental magmas.

Inclusions reveal major and trace element diversity that is not clear from analyses of whole rock lavas alone and the origin of this diversity continues to be a source of vigorous debate. One end member hypothesis is that the diversity in inclusions reflects heterogeneity in mantle source compositions. Alternatively the diversity of inclusion compositions may result from magmatic processes including crustal assimilation. In a groundbreaking discovery extreme Pb-isotopic variability\u2014spanning 50% of the range identified in global ocean island and MORB lavas\u2014was measured in olivine hosted melt inclusions from a single lava collected from the island of Mangaia (Cook Austral Islands). While many of the Mangaia inclusions host a Pb-isotopic component similar to lavas from the island a surprising result was that some inclusions host less radiogenic Pb-isotopic ratios never before seen in Mangaian lavas. The origin of the Pb isotopic diversity in these inclusions is not well understood and the discovery of isotopic variability gave rise to a host of fundamental questions. Why is it that the inclusions are not isotopically representative of the bulk magma? Is it because inclusions from a single lava trap melts from isotopically-diverse mantle sources? Or does the isotopic diversity reflect assimilation of the lithosphere during magma ascent? Unfortunately bulk abundances of elements most sensitive to crustal assimilation (like B Cl and K) have never been paired with Pb-isotopic compositions in the same inclusions from Mangaia. As a result it has not been possible to evaluate whether the Pb-isotopic variability in Mangaia inclusions relates to mantle source variability or crustal assimilation. In an attempt to evaluate the origin of the isotopic variability in inclusions from Mangaia the PI used start-up funds to undertake a pilot study with his student (Ms. Rita Cabral) in which 14 inclusions from Mangaia were analyzed for major trace and volatile elements. The data from the pilot study are intriguing and hint at a possible role for crustal assimilation. However the data are limited and robust conclusions cannot be drawn without additional data and mantle source variability is possible. In particular Pb-isotopic measurements on the inclusions are necessary to determine whether proxies for crustal assimilation relate to the Pb-isotopic variability. Thus this proposal seeks funding to make additional measurements to test the following hypotheses: 1.) If the Pb isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions is a result of crustal assimilation processes the Pb-isotopic compositions will correlate with indices of assimilation (e.g. high Cl and B). 2.) Alternatively the isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions reflects diverse mantle sources beneath Mangaia that contribute isotopically-heterogeneous melts to inclusions. To test these hypotheses this proposal seeks funding to measure 87Sr\/86Sr (which is also sensitive to assimilation of seawater and crustal materials) and Pb isotopic ratios and major trace and volatile abundances in the same inclusions and expand the study to include a larger suite of inclusions from three Mangaia lavas. The proposed measurements will constrain the relative roles of magmatic processes and mantle sources in generating heterogeneous inclusions and will be important for understanding magma transport and emplacement processes in the lithosphere.

However the two longest-lived Pacific hotspot tracks the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville seamount chains exhibit hard-to-explain differences in behavior prior to 45 Ma: (i) The Hawaiian-Emperor show a pronounced kink while the Louisville chain is gently curved and (ii) while the Louisville hotspot likely remained geographically fixed (results of recent IODP Expedition 330) Hawaii drifted 15\u00b0 south. Differences in hotspot fixity may arise from ridge capture and ridge-related flow modifying plume upwelling the mantle wind tilting plumes movement of the plume base or large-scale reorganizations of tectonic plates affecting global mantle flow. As a result these complicating processes diminish the accuracy of APM models for the Pacific Plate in particular and our understanding of mantle dynamics in general. We propose that adding a third long-lived Pacific hotspot track can help to deconvolve the effects of plate versus plume motions. Recent evidence suggests that the Rurutu hotspot is long-lived (~100 Ma) follows a hotspot track midway between Hawaii and Louisville and shows a pronounced 155\u00b0 bend like Hawaii between 35-55 Ma. Combining Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf geochemical and 40Ar\/39Ar age data will allow us to test the hypothesis that the Rurutu hotspot is both geochemically continuous and and possibly the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific. We propose to obtain new age and geochemical data for the critical region around the poorly characterized Rurutu hotspot bend. This data will help define a third Pacific hotspot track that will help deconvolve plate from plume motions between 40 and 80 Ma. Specifically we propose to test the following two hypotheses: (1) The Rurutu hotspot is a long-lived geochemically-distinct hotspot like the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots; and (2) the Rurutu hotspot exhibits a pronounced bend and the timing of the Rurutu bend matches the timing of the (pronounced) Hawaii-Emperor and (less pronounced) Louisville bends at ~50 Ma. To test these hypotheses we propose to: (1) Dredge 20 key volcanoes at the Rurutu hotspot bend--defined by the intersection of the Tuvalu and Samoa chains--to determine its precise location and timing; (2) Geochemically characterize 60 samples to evaluate a link to the modern-day Rurutu hotspot; (3) Compare the predicted Rurutu age progression from various APM models to 45 new 40Ar\/39Ar ages to be measured from these seamounts. This data from the Rurutu hotspot will allow us to trace the longest-lived hotspot in the Pacific and construct an APM model for the Pacific Plate that is less sensitive to plume motion.

Second the relative aperture of the observational arrays is small.

Several kinematic and dynamic rupture scenarios (Graves et al. 2008; Olsen et al. 2009) had been created to artificially break a 305 km long segment of the San Andreas fault from Bombay Beach on the Salton Sea to Lake Hughes 20 km northwest of Palmdale. Multiple groups have preformed the deterministic ground motion modeling for low frequencies (<1Hz) using SCEC CVM4 velocity structure and some of results were in good agreement (Bielak et al. 2010).

All research activities rely on precise event locations. Due to cylinder symmetry we cannot locate earthquakes using only the travel-time information collected by such a sub-vertical array; the polarity information must be used. Most uncertainties in locations result from the relatively large uncertainties in polarization analysis. We expect that the multiple path effects of a cluster of events shall be similar the relative locations of these events shall be much better. The relocate earthquake catalog will be used to track the migration of micro-seismic events during the post-stages periods. 2) Focal mechanisms. A single-azimuth data set (as in single well monitoring) in the far field cannot resolve the dipole perpendicular to the plane of stations and the hypocenter [Vavrycuk 2007].

For small magnitude events reliable determination of corner frequency requires accurate knowledge of Qp and Qs which can be constrained using spectral ratio derived from perforation shots [Eaton et al. 2014]. A better constraint to stress drop may help us to distinguish the events directly associating with hydraulic fracking and induced tectonic earthquakes along the fault.

In agriculture ENMs are used in biosensing enhanced nutrient transport and improved pathogen protection by controlling size surface charge polarity and electronic properties. However their proposed applications and associated responses are mostly based on assumptions that ENMs are taken up by terrestrial plants via diffusion of constituent ions through stomatal openings on leaves root epidermis or tissue injury. The dissolved ions or bio-transformed ENMs are anticipated to move through the apoplast to reach the plant vascular system following the established route of mineral nutrients through ion channels. There is limited understanding and no conclusive evidence yet on the mode of entry of ENMs and subsequent transport in plants. Advanced spectroscopic and microscopic techniques have been used to locate ENMs and transformed species within plants; however despite the depth and precision of these powerful techniques they are limited by resolution sampling bias analytical costs high exposure concentrations and sample preparation artefacts. In addition the current literature is contradictory with regards to the transport kinetics and reported mechanisms differ with plant species exposure conditions as well as growth medium. This gap in the understanding of nano-plant interaction limits utilizing ENMs in agricultural applications at their utmost potential. Sensitive endpoints at a molecular level are needed to identify the biomarkers associated with ENM cellular transport. We propose to use -omic approaches to elucidate the mode of uptake of metal based nanoparticles (MNPs) by crop plants. Our primary objectives are to: (1) characterize MNPs in natural exposure conditions and in vivo; (2) apply discovery proteomic tools to identify plasma membrane and apoplastic proteins involved in cellular uptake and transport of MNPs in plants; (3) apply untargeted metabolomics to identify metabolite regulation in plant tissues involved with MNP uptake and localization; (4) validate the candidate biomarkers using targeted proteomics and metabolomics. To address these objectives we propose root and foliar exposure of three crops (soybean corn and lettuce) grown in artificial soil medium. The plants will be exposed to MNPs such as Cu(OH)2 MoO3 Mn3O4 and CeO2 at environmentally relevant concentrations. Plant plasma membrane proteins (IMPs) and apoplastic proteins (APs) are critical candidates for this study as they participate in communication between cells and extracellular environment ion transport protein translocation\/integration and signal transduction. To achieve our goal the IMPs and APs in roots and leaves from respective root and foliar exposures will be selectively enriched in our sample pool which will then be used for discovery proteomics. The tissue metabolites will also be collected and fractionated into hydrophilic and hydrophobic components for untargeted metabolomics. Advanced high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) will be employed for the untargeted proteomics and metabolomics. Upon initial screening the candidate proteins and metabolites will be validated and quantified using targeted approaches across different exposure period and concentrations followed by meta-data integration to identify universal biomarker of MNP exposure. This workflow has been shown to be effective for drug development and targeted delivery in humans; thus it is a logical approach for elucidating MNP transport and effects mechanisms in plants.

For hydrological connectivity small sections of surrounding states will also be modeled. For those major tributaries that are not yet modeled (e.g. HUC 0502 Monongahela) and that drain into this section of the Ohio River we will use the ORSANCO monitoring data as a placeholder for the flows and loads from these watersheds. This proposed project will benefit from our existing efforts funded by USEPA since we have already established the connections with Ohio EPA and ORSANCO to obtain the needed point source and observed water quality information. Implementing the model involves obtaining a number of datasets such as topography (digital elevation model) hydrologic network and observed hydrology from USGS; landuse data from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset supplemented with the 2008 Cropland Survey for Ohio from USDA; point source and water quality observations data from Ohio EPA; ORSANCO monitoring data. The TWG project has allowed us to develop a number of software tools and algorithms for processing these large datasets to more rapidly implement each new watershed. If we did not have these tools the cost of implementing the model for these three HUCs (0503 0508 and 0509) would be approximately twice the proposed budget given the large area considered. The watersheds will be modeled at the 10-digit HUC level as shown in Figure 2. For practical purposes the models are implemented as distinct subwatersheds that can be run independently or together in a master project. Thus if someone needs to run a scenario for a small section within a watershed it is not necessary to run the entire master model. Data set collection and incorporation into the model will take approximately 3 months. Once the model is implemented and calibrated the model will be used to develop the trading coefficients for the entire state of Ohio. This involves evaluating the effect of a load reduction in a given location and its impact on the rest of the downstream watersheds. A matrix of the trading coefficients will be generated for use in the broader WQT program. The matrix will also be displayed graphically using ArcView or any other accepted Geographical Information System software. A number (approx. 20) of tradingscenarios within Ohio will be evaluated to illustrate the use of the model for WQT. The final report will detail the model implementation calibration analysis of the WQT scenarios and an explanation of the trading coefficient matrix. A proposed water quality monitoring program in support of the WQT program for the state of Ohio will also be included in the final report.

OSL is an ideal geochronometer for this study for a number of reasons. Fossil corals on the Gaviota Coast are sparse making U-series dating impractical. There are occasional mollusk shell beds but radiocarbon dating cannot be relied upon completely because the terrace ages may be beyond the upper limits of radiocarbon dating (~45-50 ka without isotopic enrichment; Walker 2005). West of the SBSYF this is almost certainly the case. Fortunately marine terrace quartz sands are abundant and have ideal characteristics for OSL dating i.e. a depositional environment and texture (fine-medium grain size well-sorted) that suggest a high degree of bleaching (Nelson et al. 2015). These characteristics mitigate potential concerns with OSL dating. Moreover local terrace sands have been shown to be amenable to OSL (Gurrola et al. 2014) further affirming the methods utility in this coastal setting. Lastly the upper limits (~150-200 ka depending on dose rate) and resolution of OSL (\u00b1 5-10%; Rhodes 2011) are sufficient to date and distinguish between the expected terrace ages of ~45 ka and ~80 ka.

A major impact of climate change with rising sea levels is increased coastal erosion of beaches and sea cliffs. Billions of dollars of property are at increased risk if coastal erosion accelerates (Ryan et al. 1999). The last powerful El Ni\u00f1o in 1998 raised local sea levels in Central California by as much as 20-30 cm (Huyer et al. 2002). This rise is equivalent to the projected sea-level rise in Central California near the end of the 21st century (Cayan et al. 2008 2009; NRC 2012). The 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o is shaping up to be a very strong event that will likely bring higher sea levels in California. Tidal records in Santa Barbara suggest that it has already risen about 15 cm as of mid-October 2015. Mean sea level rise for Santa Barbara in recent decades is 0.73 \u00b1 1.2 mm\/yr (NOAA 2015). For Southern California considering tectonic processes the rate is 1.5 to 2.4 mm\/yr (Reynolds and Simms 2015). Projected global rise in sea level is 18-48 cm by 2050 (Board of Earth Sciences and Resources 2015). The purpose of the proposed research is to quantify the extent of coastal change in beaches and sea cliffs as a result of both the expected El Ni\u00f1o storms during the winter of 2015- 2016 and the rise in sea level as a result of El Ni\u00f1o. We intend to use a combination of existing 2006 and 2009-2011 high-resolution airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) as well as new terrestrial LiDAR data which we will obtain from equipment available at the University of California Santa Barbara. Higher waves and sea levels will increase rates of coastal erosion along beaches and sea cliffs (Sallenger et al 1998; Komar 1998). However very little work has quantified these changes over a particular time period and at particular places. The 2015-2016 period provides a unique opportunity to observe changes attributable to higher sea levels and perhaps to more intense storms with higher waves. These may then be compared with existing 2006 and 2009- 2011 LiDAR airborne results to visualize and measure changes (Rosser et al. 2005; Young et al. 2006). The research will continue after the El Ni\u00f1o into 2016 to determine if erosion rates return to pre-El Ni\u00f1o values.

This in turn creates variation in demo- graphic traits \u2014 the propensity to survive more or less or to have more or fewer offspring (contrast with the actual life history an organism experiences \u2014 its demographic fate; see Kendall & Fox 2003) as well as individual growth and dispersal rates. While ecologists do use models (like linear matrix models) that classify individuals by age stage or size and sex most assume that in doing so they have captured suffi- cient variation so that further variation is simply noise of small amplitude. This is not necessarily the case. This variation in traits occurs even when within categories such as age stage size or sex. We use the term demographic heterogeneity to refer collectively to the variation in birth death growth and dispersal rates among individuals in an age stage or size class. Demographic heterogeneity can be produced by various mechanisms including genetic variabil- ity(Yashin et al. 1999 Ducrocq et al. 2000 Gerdes et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004 Isberg et al. 2006)spatial heterogeneity in the habitat(Gates and Gysel 1978 Boulding and Van Alstyne 1993 Menge et al. 1994 Winter et al. 2000 Franklin et al. 2000 Manolis et al. 2002 Bollinger and Gavin 2004 Landis et al. 2005) unequal allocation of parental care(e.g. Johnstone 2004; Manser&Avey 2000) seed heter- omorphisims(e.g. Silvertown 1984; Venable &Burquez M 1990) maternal family effect (Fox et al. 2006) learned feeding preferences (Bolnick et al. 2003) and social rank (e.g. von Holst Hutzelmeyer &Kaetzke 2002). Demographic heterogeneity is taxonomically widespread. For example heterogeneity in survival has been found in crocodiles (Isberg et al. 2006) baboons (Bronikowski et al. 2002) birds (Wintrebert et al. 2005 Fox et al. 2006) wild plants (Beckage and Clark 2003 Landis et al. 2005) domestic ani- mals(Ducrocq et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004) and humans(Yashin et al. 1999 Garibotti et al. 2006) including British aristocrats(Doblhammer and Oeppen 2003). Demographic heterogeneity has been shown to have a variety of effects on population dynamics. Heterogeneity in survival and reproduction can change the population variabliltydue to demographic sto- chasticity often reducing it relative to a homogeneous population with the same average rates. Hetero- geneity in survival if it persists throughout the life cycle creates cohort selection which in turn increases the asymptotic population growth rate and equilibrium population densities. Finally heterogeneity in dispersal ability can increase the rate at which an invading population spreads.

Establishing property rights is necessary for markets that create incentives and facilitate transactions to enhance resource value and provide environmental quality.

The GU is one of the most geologically significant and largest temporal gaps in the rock record marking the boundary between Precambrian and Phanerozoic time. It has been proposed that erosion below the GU delivered bio-limiting phosphorous to the ocean which spurred organic carbon burial oxygenation of the ocean-atmosphere system and the rise of animals. Determining when the GU developed (whether during Rodinia mantle upwelling early Rodinia breakup the Cryogenian Snowball Earth glaciations or Late Ediacaran rifting) and deciphering the size of the last erosion event preceding GU formation (whether km's or 100s of m) are critical for identifying viable mechanisms for evolutionary change during this pivotal interval of Earth history. However because the temporal gap across the GU is so substantial the timing and magnitude of erosion under the GU are largely unconstrained. Recent advances in (U-Th)\/He thermochronology allow access to the thermal histories required to unravel the history of this iconic feature. This proposal outlines a strategy to acquire zircon and titanite (U-Th)\/He data for samples along two regional transects characterized by minimal post-GU burial overprinting from: (1) the Superior Craton eastward across the Appalachian margin; and (2) the Kalahari craton westward to the Gariep belt. These transects are designed to capitalize on the PIs' collective experience working in these regions. Study sites will be targeted to fully exploit Neoproterozoic and Cambrian geologic constraints which will be vital for narrowing the range of viable thermal histories to enable discrimination between GU formation models. The results will dramatically improve constraints on the Neoproterozoic cooling   history of each margin which will be used to test competing models for GU development and significance."},{"list":158,"pis":"Francis MacDonald","start":"11\/1\/18","end":"5\/31\/20","amount":"$77,882","agency":"National Science Foundation","id":"1927851","title":"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Testing proposed rapid true polar wander in the Neoproterozoic Zavkhan Volcanics of Mongolia and the Banxi Group of South ChinaFinalize paleomagnetic and geochronologic analyses","abstract":"Extend geochemical analyses from both China and Mongolia to better assess the tectonic environment of magmatism.Additional field studies in Mongolia to expand data set and test hypotheses generated with initial dataset.

Further lakes are anticipated to be sentinels of climate change with the balance between autotrophic growth and respiration in lakes anticipated to change with increased anthropogenic activity in their watersheds and with climate change. Studies have been and are being conducted worldwide to assess the role of lakes and reservoirs in regional and global carbon cycles and efforts are underway to estimate metabolic activity in lakes. Essential to both efforts are accurate estimates of gas fluxes at the air-water interface. The gas transfer coefficient used in the calculation of fluxes depends upon turbulence at the air-water interface but in most biogeochemical studies either a fixed conservative value is used or one based on wind speed alone. Other processes which cause turbulence are neglected. We estimate that regional carbon budgets are in error by at least a factor of two and likely higher in warm water lakes due to incorrect parameterization of the gas transfer coefficient. The error is unknown in cold water lakes. The surface renewal model takes into account the various processes which induce turbulence in near-surface waters yet has never been validated for lakes. We propose to combine direct air-water flux measurements of carbon dioxide using eddy covariance techniques with in situ measurements of the water-side CO2 concentration profile turbulence and energy fluxes to evaluate and improve upon the surface renewal model of the gas transfer coefficient. We further propose studies using SF6 in lakes too small for EC studies with measurements taken on time scales of events which drive gas flux. We propose studies in an arctic temperate zone and tropical lake to capture the latitudinal variations in physical forcing which affect turbulence near the air-water interface.

Our approach for developing valid equations for k600 in small lakes over diel cycles will be to combine these short interval flux measurements with diel measurements of temperature meteorology surface currents and pCO2.

These natural hazards directly threaten surrounding communities and global air traffic. Our ability to mitigate these risks is restricted by our inability to safely measure volcanic jets or monitor them co-eruptively. Infrasound (acoustic signals with frequencies below that of human hearing) provides a means to detect the atmospheric oscillations from volcanoes at distances of meters to thousands of kilometers from the source. This project aims to use these signals to constrain the physics of volcanic jets and measure them in real-time. These measurements may be used as input parameters for aviation safety ash-cloud prediction models and toward assessing the hazard presented to local communities by a given eruption. Additionally this work will provide constraints on eruptive parameters and physics for numerical and experimental studies. Recent infrasound recordings of volcanic jets have frequency spectra similar to the acoustic signal produced by man-made jets (jet noise). For the past 60 years aeroacoustics has studied the relationship between the flow properties of man-made jets and the acoustic signal produced. Our long-term objective is to reverse this concept by determining the flow properties of volcanic jets based on the infrasound signal produced by the eruption. This work represents a first step toward this long-term goal. We begin by building a catalog of infrasonic jet noise observations to determine characteristic volcanic jet noise features and determine any correlations between these features and known eruptive parameters. This process includes searching existing infrasound databases using new signal processing tools and empirical and theoretical propagation modeling. We will then use analytical and numerical models of volcanic jets to adapt established empirical models of man-made jet noise to volcanic systems.

Volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands Alaska Peninsula and Cook Inlet are capable of sudden explosive ash-cloud forming eruptions which are potentially hazardous to passenger and freight aircraft along this heavily travelled air corridor. Many of Alaskas volcanoes are in remote locations with harsh environments. Monitoring these volcanoes represents a formidable challenge and many of the volcanoes are not instrumented. Infrasound (acoustic waves with frequencies below the 20 Hz hearing threshold of the human ear) is a rapidly developing technology to understand and monitor explosive volcanic eruptions. Modest-sized explosive eruptions produce powerful infrasound signals that propagate efficiently over thousands of kilometers in the atmosphere. However to date these signals have been recorded by sparse infrasound sensor networks limiting our understanding of their source generation and propagation through the atmosphere.

This work will contribute to understanding of tropical riverine and wetland systems in the global context of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dynamics. Furthermore recent studies have indicated that lakes and wetlands make a significant contribution to the global carbon budget because of the high rates of carbon uptake and metabolism in these systems. Therefore our research in the large and productive Amazon basin is likely to be quantitatively important globally. About 20% of the Amazon basin is seasonally inundated and these wetlands are sites of intense biological activity that can have a strong influence on the regional carbon dynamics. Understanding the effects of these dynamics on air-water exchanges of CO2 and CH4 is of critical importance if we are to estimate the net contribution of Amazon wetlands to greenhouse gas emissions. To quantify this influence it is necessary to improve estimates of the fluxes and balance of carbon incorporating the principal sources of spatial and temporal variability and developing numerical models to simulate and integrate their effects. Hence we propose to study the organic carbon dynamics and its influence on the net emissions of CO2 and CH4 on central Amazon floodplains. We propose to examine three unresolved issues: 1. The role of aquatic herbaceous macrophytes and litterfall from flooded forests as sources of organic carbon fueling the outgassing of carbon dioxide and methane from wetlands and rivers. 2. The regional seasonal and interannual variations in evasion of methane and carbon dioxide. 3. The inundation dynamics of floodplains on multiple scales and their function as a physical template for biogeochemical processes. To resolve these issues and to advance predictive capability and understanding of how the carbon balance of Amazon floodplains will respond to environmental changes requires several coordinated activities. Hydrological and hydrodynamic models will be integrated with biogeochemical analyses and models and with remotely sensed-based estimates of plant growth and phenology.

The considerable uncertainty about the estimated fluxes of methane stems from the large seasonal and inter-annual variations in ecological conditions and inundation typical of floodplains and other wetlands. In this proposed project we will combine results from our field measurements hydrological simulations and advances in remote sensing to develop mechanistic models that couple floodplain inundation dynamics to the production and emission of methane. Our work will quantify and reduce uncertainty associated with estimates of methane fluxes and expand understanding of their temporal and spatial variability. Our results will provide necessary inputs to regional atmospheric models of methane fluxes derived from airborne campaigns and satellite retrievals and provide key improvements in the tropics for models applied globally. Among tropical river systems the Amazon basin is the largest and has the most extensive floodplains. Hence our analyses will focus on aquatic systems in the Amazon basin and be extended to tropical systems elsewhere based on modeling and remote sensing. Remote sensing of inundation and vegetative dynamics will be combined with recent results from in situ measurements of methane fluxes related physical processes and hydrological models to provide regional estimates of methane fluxes. We will utilize existing datasets complemented by focused field studies to develop and validate a model of methane evasion tailored to tropical aquatic systems with strong seasonal and inter-annual variations in inundation water depths and vegetative cover.

Experiments both in the field and laboratory have added mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes of Sierran lakes and watersheds. Comparative studies of biological and hydrochemical aspects of lakes conducted from 1982 to the present provide a regional context for examination of Sierra-wide conditions and responses to global change. Recent paleo-investigations at Emerald Lake and companion lakes have provided a multi-century context for the 31-year dataset from Emerald Lake. In our LTREB renewal we propose to complete our decadal research plan to test the hypothesis that altered climate changing snow regime and changes in atmospheric composition are driving biogeochemical and ecological changes in high elevation ecosystems. We propose to continue long-term study of the Emerald Lake watershed Tokopah Valley and nearby catchments in order to test conceptual hypotheses regarding drivers of environmental change in high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. The primary foci of the proposed study are: i) continued assessment of the response of lake phytoplankton to changing atmospheric deposition and ii) continued study of the coupling between climate variability and N and P biogeochemistry. These questions will be answered through the continuation of on-going watershed measurements; additional study of lake metabolism; enhanced measurements of atmospheric deposition; and paleolimnological study of lake sediments. Climate conditions have a strong influence on potential N&P source areas on the incidence of fires on transport and deposition and lake ecology. Hence as a consequence of the considerable interannual variability in Californias Mediterranean climate it is essential to conduct these studies for at least ten years.

This is particularly important when considering projects that are expected to produce environmental benefits across multiple resource categories and spatiotemporal scales. Hence a project have been conceived by the Tahoe Scientific Advisory Council that will contribute information and tools relevant to objectively evaluating landscape-scale projects purporting to provide multiple benefits in a changing environment. This project will initiate the assembly of the structural elements necessary to develop a decision support framework for the largest watershed in the Tahoe Basin. The project will: 1) provide a decision support framework for objectively evaluating the benefits of multi-resource projects and 2) provide tools for the identification of meaningful metrics for monitoring. The Council convened a workshop of scientists and agency representatives to review and document the scope of environmental and management components relevant to the Upper Truckee River (UTR) watershed (Figure 1). This information will be used to describe important drivers linkages and outcomes (D-L-O) of environmental processes and management actions within a set of linked or nested conceptual models. The conceptual models will include written narratives references and performance characteristics along with graphical representation of the system components that together communicate the D-L-O characteristics to a broad stakeholder audience. Draft conceptual models will be presented to the Upper Truckee River Watershed Advisory Group (UTRWAG) for review and input. This feedback will be incorporated and used to refine selected sub-models of identified importance and to identify a draft set of indicator metrics. The conceptual models and indicator metrics will be integrated into a decision support framework following the approach of DiGennero and others (San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science 2012 v10). The utility and efficacy of the resulting DSF will be tested using a sample set of potential UTR watershed projects selected by UTRWAG from the existing Environmental Improvement Program project list.

We intend to introduce and test evolutionary improvements to techniques for measuring radiometric optical properties at the site.

The NSPB is a flexible easily deployed and is a cost-effective alternative to long-term moored optical buoy installations. The NSPB eliminates the need to address biofouling and extrapolation to the sea surface from discrete fixed depths which complicate data analysis from long-term moored optical buoy data. This approach also avoids modeling of upwelling radiance from the reflected sky radiance which bedevils above-water approaches. We believe a global network of short-term autonomous profile systems patterned after the system proposed here would change how ocean color satellite vicarious calibration is performed. The NSPB system will also make direct and diffuse incident irradiance determinations which will be useful for assessing aerosol and cloud optical properties and incident spectral irradiance at the sea surface.

Our research within this time series context has focused on developing and applying methods for extending the reach of in situ time-series of oceanographic studies by using optical and remote sensing data to provide novel information and spatial context. Our past and ongoing research efforts have been oriented toward analyzing the linkages between ocean optical properties (as measured in situ and from spaceborne sensors) and biogeochemical processes such as CDOM cycling and primary productivity as modulated by seasonal cycles and mesoscale processes. Previous and ongoing studies have also made use of BBOP in situ data in combination with imagery and other sensor data from EOS and related platforms in both algorithm development validation and in answering science questions.

Direct measurement of the in-water solar flux divergence or radiant heating rates allows variations in solar forcing of stratification that can be significant to be accurately quantified (e.g. Ohlmann et al. 1996 Ohlmann et al. 1998 Ohlmann et al. 2000 Hosegood et al. 2008). Solar attenuation depends primarily on upper ocean chlorophyll biomass concentration in open ocean waters. Chlorophyll biomass depends (to first order) on the availability of light and nutrients. When measured together these data inform on bio-physical feedbacks. This statement of work describes the proposed measurement of surface irradiance and in water solar flux profiles during the Dynamo field experiment. Collecting solar flux profiles allows upper ocean stratification an important component of upper ocean mixed layer evolution to be quantified. It is also proposed that water samples be collected for laboratory analysis of chlorophyll biomass and nutrients. These data are necessary to understand why the in-water solar flux divergence varies and the sampling adds little cost to the project. Upper ocean models work with solar transmission defined as solar flux at depth relative to the incident value just above the surface. Surface irradiance will thus be sampled with a radiometer mounted on the ships mast. The complete data set to be collected throughout the MJO-evolution cruises will provide the necessary solar transmission information for accurate quantification of upper-ocean mixing and will allow the bio-physical influence on stratification\/dissipation to be better understood. Profiles of downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance in 11 spectral bands (~300 to ~700 nm) will be measured using a Satlantic Profiler II Radiometer (www.satlantic.com\/profiler). The radiometer is a long (122 cm) slender (9 cm in diameter) hand-deployed freefalling instrument (retrieved using a small winch) that eludes ship motion and shadow. Coincident measurements of downwelling spectral irradiance and total solar radiation incident at the surface will be made so that solar transmission profiles can be computed. It is estimated that solar flux profiles will be made to ~40 meters every few hours each day. It is possible that profiles in the morning and evening hours when total solar energy is reduced can be made shallower. Water samples at discrete depths will be collected once each day with the ships CTD\/Rosette system and analyzed for chlorophyll concentration and nutrients. The noontime CTD\/Rosette casts will be performed to ~150 meters so that the deep chlorophyll maximum and nutricline are resolved. The radiometer primarily resolves the visible portion of the entire solar spectrum. This is sufficient to resolve the solar flux at depths beneath ~5 m as energy in the ultra-violet and near-infrared spectral regions is completely attenuated in the top few meters of the ocean.

The goal of the work proposed here is to generate a statistically rigorous timeline for the appearances of skeletal animals during the first ~25 million years of the Cambrian (Nemakit-Daldynian and Tommotian stages). It will build on earlier work by PIs Maloof and Porter and their collaborators that used radiometrically calibrated carbon isotope chemostratigraphy to reconstruct the pattern of appearances through this interval at two million year resolution. That work suggested that the diversification of skeletal animals began early and extended throughout this interval with pulses of appearances ca. 540538 Ma 534530 Ma and 524522 Ma. However it is not clear to what extent preservational biases and uncertainties in correlation and dating have influenced these patterns. This research effort will use recently developed statistical methods to address these concerns. In particular it will (1) use a new method developed by PI Wang and colleagues to estimate a confidence interval for the duration of the diversification (and thus provide an estimate of its rate) and (2) use both a randomization procedure and a new method developed by Wang and an undergraduate student to identify the most likely number of pulses of origination and their timing.

The PIs will construct a comprehensive database of animal fossil occurrences litho- and chemostratigraphy and U-Pb zircon geochronology of interbedded volcaniclastics. Multiproxy records of variable diversity and completeness from around the globe will be correlated using the CONOP seriation software. The resulting composite stratigraphy will place each local record in relative and absolute time based not on one variable like FADs or ?13C but rather on all available stratigraphic observations simultaneously.

However at the moment adaptation mechanisms especially provided by means of free-markets are studied much less. While there are some studies indicating that adaptation is likely to help the exact scope and the magnitudes of the effect of various adaptation mechanisms on climate change costs are not well understood. This research will help fill in this gap in the literature. Prior research on migration as an adaptation mechanism allowed for the assessment of the efficacy of migratory responses as a means of adapting to rises in temperature. In this effort I found that migration while having a somewhat small effect on average will be very helpful in reducing the costs for the areas which are extremely hit hard by the climate change (notably Florida and some currently densely populated areas on the East Coast). That paper provided a methodological contribution by constructing a discrete choice model which explicitly accounts for general equilibrium effects. This model takes into account that while population density might affect individual migratory decisions it is also a function of those same individual decisions on the aggregate level. Currently my research accounts for general equilibrium effects for population density only. One might expect that wages might change as a result of both migration (due to change in labor demand) and climate change (supply side shocks). These will be the next steps in my research.

However such studies take a cross-sectional approach analyzing disproportionality at one point in time. This research proposes a longitudinal comparative mixed-methods approach investigating the social structures and contexts that affect if how and under what circumstances disproportionality changes over time. The research focuses on three questions: 1) How does disproportionality in the production of pollution change over time? 2) What drives those changes? and 3) What factors account for the persistence of egregious polluters? These questions are answered by analyzing facility-level toxic chemical emissions data reported to the US EPA's Toxics Release Inventory from 1988 to 2012 for three industry classifications- pulp and paper milling (NAICS 3221) printed circuit board manufacturing (NAICS 334412) and PVC pipe manufacturing (NAICS 326122).

The structure of the ophiolite makes it clear that the crust formed in an extensional environment similar to modern fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges making it an invaluable resource for studying MOR processes. However many researchers have also highlighted important differences between the Oman-U.A.E. ophiolite and modern ridges including geochemical differences between MOR basalts and extrusive lavas in the ophiolite and the presence of multiple generations of plutonism and volcanism within the mantle and crust. To determine how observations from the ophiolite can be applied to modern spreading centers it is necessary to understand the tectonic setting during formation and emplacement of the ophiolite. The Principal Investigator recently completed an extensive U-Pb zircon geochronology and Nd isotope study of the ophiolite. The results from this study together with previous work by other researchers suggest that the age and composition of magmatism that post-dates formation of the ophiolite crust can provide important new insight into the tectonic history of the ophiolite. The proposed research would target three series of rocks: silicic sills and dikes in the mantle with Nd isotopic ratios that are distinct from the ophiolite crust; intrusive and extrusive rocks in the crust that post date the main phase of crustal growth; and leucocratic melts and amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic rocks from the metamorphic sole. The distinct isotopic and geochemical compositions of the first two series are likely related to development of a thrust fault or subduction zone below the ophiolite. Initial U-Pb zircons dates from these rocks are <0.10.25 Ma younger than the ophiolite crust. Further high precision geochronology and geochemical analyses including Nd and Hf isotopic analyses will map out the spatial and temporal development of subduction or thrusting along the length of the ophiolite. High-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology and geochemistry of the metamorphic sole will provide complementary information on conditions in the under thrust slab.

Historically MOD10 snow cover and albedo based on simple algorithms such as the Normalized Snow Difference Index (NDSI) have been used.

Second we will use the information gained in this first part of the project to plan and carry out a sampling and measurement scheme most likely to yield a record of centennial variability in 10Be fallout flux that can be matched to the 10Be flux record from the Greenland ice cores. Measurement of bulk 10Be in NAVC sediments: The specific analytical tasks in this project include locating and obtaining samples of NAVC sediments subsampling them for 10Be analysis and measuring 10Be concentrations by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Our primary source of samples will be an extensive archive of cores of NAVC sediments that PI Ridge has collected over many years and that are stored at Tufts University. One important aspect of this part of the project however is to ensure that subsamples are not cross-contaminated or contaminated with modern 10Be during collection. This requirement may restrict use of archived cores that are highly fractured or otherwise difficult to sample cleanly. If we can not obtain the samples we need from this archive we will revisit source outcrops and collect new samples typically by collecting short cores from outcrops using a hammered-PVC-pipe procedure that Ridge has employed for many years. Ridge will have primary responsibility for locating archived and new sample material and correlating it to the NAVC although students will also be closely involved in this process and all project personnel will participate. 10Be concentrations are measured by an isotope dilution method in which a 9Be carrier is added to the sample the entire sample is digested and the Be extracted and the Be isotope ratio is measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). All aspects of this process are proven reliable and efficient. We will carry out Be extraction from sediments in a purpose-built chemistry laboratory at the University of Vermont (see Facilities and Resources) using a total-fusion method described by Stone (1996) and further refined during the past few years by Balco Bierman and Biermans students. At the 10Be concentrations we expect to measure in this project (> 107 atoms g?1) AMS measurement is rapid (a few minutes per sample) and precise (?1-2% analytical uncertainty). Research focus 1: systematics of 10Be deposition in varved sediments. We will use several strategies in the first part of the project. First we will investigate how 10Be is delivered to glacial and nonglacial varved sediments. We hypothesize that 10Be deposition is seasonally focused due to effects such as more effective scavenging by fine sediment during winter suppression of fallout 10Be delivery to the lake during winter due to snow and ice cover and the strong overall seasonality of sediment transport and deposition. We will investigate this by characterizing 10Be concentrations and their variability within both summer and winter layers to investigate seasonal effects as well as laterally within a single varve to investigate the effect of sediment source variation between direct glacial sediment and runoff from the landscape. Understanding which if any of these processes are important may suggest means to preferentially sample fallout 10Be rather than recycled 10Be. Second we will determine whether or not short-period solar variability in particular the diagnostic 11-year Schwabe cycle is present. As noted in many ice-core studies (Beer et al. 1994; Yiou et al. 1997; Steig et al. 1998) observing the 11-year cycle in a 10Be concentration record clearly shows that 10Be fallout variations are recorded (the reverse is not necessarily true: if we did not observe the 11-year cycle it could signal only that it was suppressed by a multi-year residence time for fallout 10Be in the lake and catchment which would not affect recording of centennial-scale variability). Analytical work for this part of the project will require approximately 90 10Be measurements including paired summer and winter analyses on a number of glacial and nonglacial sections (approx. 40 analyses) and analyses of at least two short continuous sections at a resolution adequate to observe the 11-year period (e.g. two-year spacing over a 50-year period; 50 samples). Research focus 2: generating a long 10Be flux record suitable for correlation. In the second part of the project we will choose a section of the NAVC from which to generate a long 10Be record with resolution appropriate to matching the centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux observed in the Greenland ice cores and then generate this record. At present absent any new information we may gain from the first part of the project described above we think the nonglacial varve section at Newbury is the most likely section of the NAVC to yield such a record for three reasons. First varves are relatively thin which limits dilution of the fallout signal. Second centennial-scale variations in 10Be flux during this time interval are suitable for correlation at the needed precision as demonstrated by Muscheler et al. (2008). Third this section is one of the longest continuous sections in the NAVC which permits us to generate as long a record as possible from a single site: this avoids any potential complications related to patching together 10Be records from multiple locations within the lake system.

This project combines lidar and field-based investigation of fluvial terraces along the Yakima River with cosmogenic radionuclide geochronology of terrace cover deposits to define spatial and temporal patterns of river downcutting over potentially active structures in the Yakima Fold and Thrust belt (YFTB). The primary question we seek to address is whether incision of the Yakima River reflects differential uplift in response to late-Quaternary growth and development of the Yakima folds. Increasing recognition that reverse faults and folds of the YFTB represent potential earthquake sources underscores the need to resolve the contribution of geologically young deformation to the topographic development of these structures. The Yakima River terraces between Kittitas Valley and Roza Gap represent ideal landforms for reconstructing this history. Intact surfaces and exposed gravel cover deposits suggest a rich archive of sustained fluvial downcutting over three fault-cored anticlinal ridges Manastash Ridge Umtanum Ridge and Selah Butte from north to south. Preliminary mapping field reconnaissance and downstream correlation of terrace remnants reveals multiple generations of surfaces spanning these structures as well as sufficiently thick cover deposits for 10Be\/26Al burial dating of capping gravels based on the isochron method. Specific questions that data collected by this project can address include: 1) whether downcutting of the Yakima River reflects late-Quaternary growth of YTFB anticlines (as expressed by uplifted terraces) occurred in response to recent slip and related uplift on the underlying reverse faults 2) how spatial and temporal patterns of fluvial incision reveal the locus of surface deformation along the Yakima River and 3) the relationship among incision and folding of the Yakima River terraces to slip on the underlying reverse faults. Investigation of these topics will shed light on the rate timing and magnitude of surface deformation along the Yakima River canyon and improve our understanding of how contemporary shortening is partitioned among individual structures within the YFTB. Reducing losses from earthquakes. This project will contribute to reducing losses from earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest by characterizing surface deformation and fault activity for structures with an unknown late-Quaternary history of deformation.

The first project investigates the causes of the systematic depletion in Mo (relative to Ce and Pr  which have similar bulk partition coefficients) that the student discovered in many granitic suites through study of the Mo inventory in common crustal rocks. This depletion may be caused by i) loss of Mo to a magmatic vapor phase (MVP) during late-stage differentiation ii) loss of Mo during crystal fractionation in the crust due to its partitioning into Ti-bearing phases and\/or iii) loss of Mo to a Ti-bearing phase (e.g. rutile) in subducted oceanic crust. To evaluate these possibilities we will i) determine the Mo abundances and partitioning in xenolithic eclogites from the Man Shield Sierra Leone that have been interpreted to be residues of Archean oceanic crust trapped within the cratonic mantle and ii) analyze a calc-alkaline differentiation suite to determine whether Mo is lost to Fe-Ti oxides. The second project seeks to understand the systematic change in Mo isotopic composition of the upper continental crust that the student discovered through analyses of glacial diamictite composites. We hypothesize that the trend to lower S98Mo seen in diamictites deposited from the Archean to the Paleozoic results from retention of isotopically light Mo within Fe and Mn hydroxides developed in the regolith following the GOE. To test this hypothesis we plan to analyze Mo isotopes in two well-characterized weathering profiles developed on basalt and a diabase for which mineralogy major and trace elements and Li and Mg isotopes have previously been determined. If our hypothesis stands we expect the basalt profile to exhibit a lighter Mo isotope signature as it contains abundant Fe-Mn oxides and hydroxides relative to the diabase profile. These data in combination with the Mo isotope data for the glacial diamictites may allow us to track the onset of oxidative weathering of the continents. The final project evaluates the degree to which variably chalcophile elements like Mo partition into sulfides in the mantle through a study of well characterized massif peridotites. In addition to determining chalcophile element partitioning behavior we seek to provide additional constraints on the abundances of these elements (many of which are moderately to highly volatile e.g. As Cd Ga In Sn Tl) in the primitive mantle. For this work we will analyze a wide array of chalcophile elements in both whole rocks and minerals of well-characterized peridotites from the Pyrenees.

Grasslands in California cover over 10 million hectares (Jackson 1985) are dominated by annual grasses and are important ecosystems in the State. However we have found comparable microbial dynamics in California grassland and Bishop pine forest so we have confidence that the mechanisms we evaluate occur in other ecosystem types as well. The research will take place at the UCSB Sedgwick Reserve which is located 50 km from the coast in the Santa Ynez Valley (43o42??30????N 120o2??30????W). The climate is Mediterranean and characteristic of interior California with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Average rainfall is 380 mm\/yr but varies widely; El Ni\u00f1o years are notably rainy. The soils are pachic argixerolls in valley bottoms and typic argixerolls on slopes. The vegetation is dominated by Mediterranean annual grasses including Bromus diandrus B. hordaceous and Avena fatua. Our main site will be in the Figueroa watershed previously studied by Schimel and Holden. Analyzing the mechanisms involved requires controlled microcosm experiments that will be described below but to explore how these mechanisms regulate how varying plant C inputs and moisture influence soil C storage we propose a field experiment in which we modify: 1) plant C- inputs during the growing season (by thinning) and 2) the length of the dry season (by watering & rainout shelters). We will establish 3 blocks of 16 plots each (1 m x 1m) and establish a factorial design in which we create gradients of plant inputs and the length of the summer drought. We will use modeling to integrate between the micro- and macro-scales. To modify plant inputs we will thin plots by hand to remove either 1\/3 2\/3 or all the biomass (plus a control). Plots will be established initially after plants germinate in the fall of 2012 and new sprouts will be removed weekly or as necessary to maintain these approximate proportions. Soil moisture is likely to vary as transpiration losses will be lower in the thinned plots but surface evaporation may partially compensate. Importantly annual grasses senescence and die shortly after seed-set not when the soils dry out. Thus at the beginning of the summer there will be a suite of plots with different amounts of dead roots to serve as substrate within the soils with relatively similar moisture conditions (depending on the timing of spring rainfall). Dry-down after senescence will be purely by evaporation. Moisture manipulations will include control lengthened summer drought shortened drought and no drought. To extend the drought we will build rainout shelters to prevent rewetting during the winter following the thinning treatments. To shorten the drought we will use weekly drip irrigation. The goal is not to keep soils constantly wet but to mimic episodic precipitation and prevent soils from drying fully. The short-drought treatment will be irrigated into July then allowed to dry normally roughly halving the length of the typical drought. The no-drought treatment will be watered into October. We will regularly weed the watered-plots during the summer to remove new sprouts. Soil moisture will be monitored continuously (using soil moisture probes and dataloggers) in the experimental plots. Soil samples will be collected from all treatments to analyze C dynamics at four points through the year: 1) At peak live plant biomass late in the growing season (April\/May) 2) early summer (just before the short-drought watering ends; late June) 3) midsummer (August) and 4) the end of the dry season (October or early January for the extended drought treatment). We will collect samples from the top 10 cm and analyze the essential C pools including roots light and heavy fraction OM microbial biomass etc. As these measures will be coupled to the work specifically testing the research hypotheses we describe the details of those analyses in those sections. The field sampling will assess how environmental factors (C-supply and moisture) regulate C-pools and microbial activities and the begin identifying the mechanisms connecting them. We will couple these to laboratory incubation studies to tease apart the specific mechanisms.

(1993) showed that Eriophorum vaginatum the plant species that dominates arctic tussock tundra not only can use organic N-sources but actually grows better with amino acids as a sole N-source than with inorganic N salts. This catalyzed a cascade of research that transformed our vision of the plant-soil N-cycle; small N-containing organic compounds have replaced NH4+ as the centerpoint of the N cycle. A challenge of this shifting view however is that no one has actually quantified for any plant species growing in the wild let alone for E. vaginatum-- how much of its total N demand is met by organic N-sources! The challenge to answering this question has been methodological; standard 15N isotope tracer methods show that many plants can take up amino acids but without accounting for dilution of the 15N tracer into the native N pools as they rapidly turn over they can not assess how much of the native compounds are taken up by plants. This project would overcome this problem and answer the question \"Do plants really use organic N?\" The project would use a combination of methods integrated through simulation modeling. The key novel method is microdialysis in which a probe the size of a root is inserted into the soil a carrier solution flows through it and small molecules diffuse into it. If water is used as the carrier it creates a diffusion gradient while if a dextran solution is used it draws water into the probe and so creates mass flow. Thus this can indicate which substrates in soil are moving to the root surface. Microdialysis will be coupled with intact root uptake kinetic studies isotope partitioning and analyzing diffusion and transport of amino acids NH4+ and NO3- through soil to parameterize a root uptake model that will be used to synthesize and integrate the results. This will allow evaluate the actual N sources used by E. vaginatum. The first phase of the work will be done under controlled conditions in the greenhouse; then having refined the methods and assessed model parameters we will move into the field to assess seasonal patterns of N uptake and how it is affected by environmental manipulations.

Soils contain more C than the atmosphere and aboveground vegetation combined (Ciais et al. 2013) and will undeniably play a major role in determining future climate conditions. However due to the complexities of biogeochemical processes governing soil C storage it is largely unknown whether the role of soil will be to sequester C or instead to contribute further to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Defining the stability of this highly relevant C pool and predicting its behavior under future climate scenarios is imperative for understanding and mitigating global climate change. This challenge cannot be overcome without better constraining the primary controls of soil C dynamics across ecosystem types. Improving knowledge of the primary controls of soil C storage requires measurements of distinct soil C pools that are repeatable and comparable across different soil and ecosystem types. However a consistent set of methodologies assessing the fundamental biogeochemical processes governing soil C storage is currently lacking (Jandl et al. 2014). Datasets are often collected using entirely different methodologies or at vastly different resolutions (molecular- to ecosystem-scale) limiting our ability to integrate process-level understanding into terrestrial ecosystem models. Overcoming this challenge begins with the careful evaluation of existing datasets calibration and standardization of methodologies for future data collection and data integration into models.

The common approach for atmospheric correction is to use top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiance in the near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared (SWIR) to select a \u2018standard aerosol model and to then use this model to calculate the TOA atmospheric radiance in the visible (VIS). This approach suffers from limitations that severely restrict the accuracy of water-leaving radiance retrievals especially in coastal regions covered by absorbing aerosols. We propose using radiance observations in the near ultra-violet (NUV) and O2 A-band as well as polarized multiangle radiance measurements in the VIS-NIR-SWIR to improve the efficacy of atmospheric correction for remote sensing of coastal waters. We will mostly utilize currently sponsored flights of the Airborne Visible\/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) onboard an ER-2 (high-altitude) aircraft to obtain the requisite NUV and O2 A-band over the coast of California. We will provide the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) onboard the ER-2 at minimal cost to obtain the requisite multiangle VIS-NIR-SWIR polarized radiance. We will expand existing inversion algorithms to include these radiance data and expand our ocean model to include independent variations for underwater-light scattering and absorption. Validation of atmospheric correction results will be performed by comparing the resulting water-leaving radiance with ship-based measurements from the NASA Plumes and Blooms (PnB) ocean color project. We will compare our ocean color retrievals with those retrieved from coincident satellite observations and perform extensive sensitivity studies to evaluate the benefits to atmospheric correction of adding NUV radiance O2 radiance and multiangle VIS-NIR-SWIR polarized radiance to the common suite of VIS-NIR-SWIR ocean color observations. The proposed research is the first to date to examine in detail and quantify the anticipated improvement in atmospheric correction when such measurements are included. The need for NUV radiance measurements to achieve this objective has been recognized in the recent formulation of threshold requirements for the NASA Pelagic and Coastal Ecosystem (PACE) mission. The PACE mission also advocates the contemporaneous use of multispectral and multiangle polarized radiance and of O2 A-band radiances to improve atmospheric correction. The results of the proposed research will also benefit other planned NASA missions such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) and the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) missions which add UV (and O2) bands and also require improved atmospheric correction algorithms. Analyzing the AVIRIS RSP and ship based measurements is a highly complex undertaking that requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists. Dr. Chowdhary has worked for over a decade on the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and ocean properties from RSP measurements. He developed a state-of-the-art radiative transfer program for polarized underwater light and is a member of the Glory Science Team (GST) and the PACE Science Definition Team (PSDT). Dr. Alexandrov Dr. van Diedenhoven and Dr. Knobelspiesse have worked extensively on developing state-of-the-art inversion algorithms for RSP and APS data and are also members of the GST.

Wind relaxation events plumes and blooms are some of the mechanisms responsible for the mixing and transport of organic and inorganic materials such as larvae nutrients pollutants and sediments along the continental shelf. In the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) California these mechanisms cause dramatic changes in the color of the ocean on time scales of days to weeks. The variability of ocean color on short timescales has not been well characterized or accounted for by satellite remote sensing due to revisit time and sampling issues which makes such observations impossible. Moreover many ocean processes tend to develop under overcast conditions when no imagery or in situ data is being collected biasing the assessment of those systems to clear sky conditions. Underestimation of ocean productivity is also expected because phytoplankton pigmentation adapts to changes in light availability and we might be biasing satellite observations of phytoplankton biomass to high light clear sky conditions. My research objective is to characterize the variability of bio-optical properties on time scales of days to weeks in the Santa Barbara Channel and account for the observations that have been missed by satellite systems due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. An electric glider will be used to make repeated bio-optical and physical measurements of the water column during plumes blooms and relaxation events at excellent temporal and spatial resolutions nearly independent of weather conditions. An extensive set of in situ data will be synthesized and used to complement NASA satellite ocean color data. The characterization of ocean color variability in the SBC in finer time scale will provide new insights about how the ocean responds to physical disturbances what are the ecological implications of rapid changes in bio-optical properties of the water and how the current under sampling influences how much we know about coastal marine ecosystems and primary productivity.

Spectral backscattering models perform well in oligotrophic marine regions due to the lack of terrestrially derived particles while spectral absorption models work well in productive regions due to their ability to key into the flattening of spectral absorption features in larger particles due to the package effect.

This measurement capability is essential for creating longterm satellite climate data records of the ocean biosphere  but the costs of building and deploying existing moored buoy systems are excessive ($Ms to build & ~$1M\/y to deploy for each site). Our system the Near Surface Profiling Buoy (NSPB) will autonomously collect 100s of high-quality near-surface irradiance \/ radiance profiles during each multi-day deployment as part of a standard oceanographic research cruise. The NSPB is built upon recent advances in optical profiling instrumentation designed for turbid water environments that is adapted to the calibration and validation of ocean color satellite data. The NSPB system is aimed at making day-long to week-long deployments improving the likelihood of high quality match-ups with satellite data than is possible with conventional profiling techniques. This will alleviate wire time constraints for shared research cruises maximizing the return on research vessel time (often >$50K\/day). The NSPB will be a cost-effective alternative to long-term moored optical buoy installations for satellite ocean color sensor calibration and eliminates the need for addressing biofouling and extrapolation of subsurface signals to the sea surface which are the major sources of uncertainty for long-term moored systems. We will test and deploy the NSPB system in both coastal and open ocean conditions as part of on-going UCSB research projects in the Santa Barbara Channel (PnB) and the Sargasso Sea (BBOP). System performance will be assessed and compared with traditional long-term moored buoy systems and conventional ship-based spectroradiometry profiling. All radiometric measurements will be fully characterized and tied to NIST standards and system radiometric performance will be monitored at UCSB. Broader Impacts: This equipment development will help reenergize long-term field research programs conducted by the UCSB group. More importantly it will help solve a national need for a low-cost high-performance flexible buoy system for the calibration and validation of satellite ocean color observations. This development project has the potential to greatly improve the accuracy of present and future satellite ocean color sensors which will have impacts far beyond this instrumentation development request. It will also involve a significant collaboration between academic researchers and the private sector that will advance the state of the art in optical technology and facilitate acquisition of quality data and instrumentation for long-term records of the ocean biosphere.

Biophysical models consisting of ocean circulation models combined with Lagrangian particle tracking are now widely used to provide insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of larval connectivity that remain unobtainable through empirical approaches. However many of the biological assumptions used to characterize larval life history in these models are quite general and the impacts of these assumptions have yet to be rigorously tested. Our goal in this proposal is to quantify How important are the details of larval biology in estimates of connectivity and long-term population dynamics? To answer this question we propose to study the spatial and temporal impacts of larval biological factors on site-to-site connectivity and long- term population growth using a biophysical model for nearshore species in the Southern California Bight (SCB). Four major larval biological factors will be investigated: (1) temperature effects on larval growth maturation and mortality (2) vertical swimming behavior (3) spatial\/temporal variability in larval production and (4) role of habitat on settlement. Using a biophysical model of the SCB differences in larval connectivity due to the biological factors will be assessed statistically by comparing connectivity estimates that incorporate the additional biological factors to a baseline of connectivity estimates calculated from passive neutrally buoyant particles. We will also employ a spatial demographic model driven by the connectivity estimates to quantify the influence of biological factors on long-term population dynamics. The proposed work will generate significant insights into the various aspects of larval biology that are critical for determining larval connectivity and for projecting population dynamics into the future. The results of this project will improve the credible application of biophysical modeling approaches to scientific studies of coastal species as well as to marine spatial planning and -fisheries management.

Variability in inherent and apparent optical properties as well as biogeochemical properties such as sediment and chlorophyll concentrations is exceptional across the region (Aurin et al. 2010 Aurin & Dierssen 2012). Recent research has shown that the waters are optically complex and other constituents besides phytoplankton play an important role in light absorption and scattering within the estuary. Namely colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended sediment are flushed into the estuary from rivers and these substances serve to absorb considerable amounts of blue light (400-500 nm) and also backscatter light across the visible spectrum. Because of this optical complexity the standard NASA open ocean algorithms for assessing chlorophyll are not intended to be used and are highly inaccurate. Semi-analytical models can be used to retrieve the absorption and backscattering properties of dissolved and suspended materials of coastal environments and Aurin et al. (2010) has already optimized a semi-analytical ocean color algorithm for the dynamic and optically complex LIS estuary. The model provides a means to estimate the contributions of absorption and backscattering coefficients of each component (cdom nap and phytoplankton) and these derived optical properties can then be used to estimate biogeochemical parameters such as total suspended material (TSM) and chlorophyll (Chl). This tuned model however has not yet been regularly applied to imagery from the current ocean color satellites NPP VIIRS and MODIS Aqua and Terra. Because of the challenges in accurately retrieving biogeochemical properties in complex estuaries little work has been done assessing the spatial patterns of biomass and the relationships between temperature and chlorophyll in this region. This work aims to improve the standard satellite image processing to retrieve more accurate measures of phytoplankton biomass. With application of new algorithms we are now poised to assess the long-term relationship between surface temperature and chlorophyll and begin to tackle questions related to how LIS has changed over the last 15 years in response to climate and anthropogenic forcings.

Attempts at creating a facies model for hyperpycnal flow deposits are based on either ancient examples where their presence can only be inferred from sedimentary characteristics or modern studies that sample the flows themselves but not necessarily their deposits. The study of Quaternary systems bridges the gap between modern processes which provide predictive metrics of sedimentary characteristics and ancient deposits representing petroleum reservoirs. The few existing Quaternary examples of deposits produced by hyperpycnal flows focus on the broad scale of deposition and rarely describe individual geomorphic features resulting from hyperpycnal flows. A recent marine bathymetric survey of the northern Santa Barbara Channel continental shelf by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) revealed the presence of shallow-water submarine fans immediately offshore of several small mountainous streams. Based on observations of modern discharges from these and similar systems in the northern Santa Barbara Channel we hypothesis that these geomorphic features represent the deposits of hyperpycnal flows and dense bedload-dominated underflows emanating from steep mountain catchments. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize these features using high-resolution seismic profiles sediment grab samples underwater camera operations and shallow cores. The characterization of these deposits will allow an evaluation of their potential for reservoir quality sands and provide one of the few modern examples of a subaqueous fan delta from a semi-arid setting.

However the only viable archive along this coastline that has been examined is Carpinteria Slough which appears to be undergoing large environmental shifts at the same time as the purported large earthquakes potentially masking any potential tsunami deposits within the slough (Reynolds et al. 2015). Most of the coastline of the Santa Barbara Channel is marked by cliffs or sandy beaches with very few marshes like Carpinteria Slough to preserve evidence for tsunami inundation.

The gypsums of western Oklahoma provide natural resources for local economic development but also pose a risk to transportation and other infrastructure. The area is prone to karst and similar to the neighboring Texas Panhandle the age and geologic controls on karst are still relatively poorly understood. During a mapping project of the Washita National Battlefield in western Oklahoma the PI and a former undergraduate student noted the development of inverted topography from karst. The purpose of this proposal is to expand the limited mapping (<35 km2) conducted as part of that project in order to better understand the distribution of karst landforms in the region and gain better insights into the timing and controls on karst formation in western Oklahoma. Our central hypothesis is that karst follows the major late Quaternary drainages of the region. If this is true it suggests a tie between river incision and karst in the region. However this leaves unresolved whether the karst controlled river development or river incision lead to karst formation. The relationship between karst and the other Cenozoic stratigraphic units (e.g. Neogene Ogallala Formation Quaternary Terraces) will allow for this differentiation. In order to test our central hypothesis we will map the surface geology of two quadrangles in western Oklahoma. We expect to find that the inverted topographic features within our study area created due to karst are only found along the major stream courses and the karst cross-cuts the Ogallala Formation but not the Quaternary terraces. If our hypothesis is correct that would suggest that karst in this region is no older than the stream courses.

One of the main goals of the PBIC is to facilitate research in the earthquake community by providing readily accessible seismic monitoring stations for deployment in the southern California region. This year the Portable Instrument Center is starting to upgrade the data acquisition technology to current real-time systems capable of integrating directly with the SCSN operations. Over the course of SCEC3 using its two newer real-time stations the PBIC has demonstrated the capability to deploy and integrate its stations into the regional network providing high-quality observations that are being used for earthquake locations and shake map applications. These stations have proven to be dependable and require very little maintenance. The previous generation of SCEC portable equipment is now coming up on two decades of operations. This older equipment is no longer completely reliable or cost-effective to deploy as it requires regular site visits and post-processing efforts. Data recovery is about 75% in the winter months and as low as 50% in the summer months due to the age of the equipment and failure of the older SCSI hard drives in the warmer summer temperatures.

We will also test a broader range of technology and policy scenarios and identify policy instruments that help promote renewable energy technologies. Our first step is to build an integrative model centered on a system dynamics framework coupled with life cycle inventories (LCIs) of various renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies. In so doing we will capitalize on our previous USDA\/DOE project in which we integrated system dynamics model with life cycle assessment (LCA) to identify cost-effective pathways to achieving the national Renewable Fuel Standard (see http:\/\/forio.com\/simulate\/umn\/rfs2\/simulation). Another major source of data will be our ongoing project on low-carbon energy technologies including wind photovoltaics concentrated solar power geothermal hydropower and carbon capture and storage. Under this project LCIs of renewable energy technologies and other low-carbon energy technologies are compiled and they are connected to different policy scenarios that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 to 2050. This model accounts for technology change and changing energy mix over time but the model does not currently interact with policy interventions. Coupling the data and results acquired from this project with a system dynamics model will enable us to simulate different policy and technology scenarios. The data and the model that have been compiled so far do not include those of shale gas development. Therefore after construction of the integrative model we will add the component of shale gas and develop an array of technology and policy scenarios to simulate potential influences that rising shale gas production would exert on the rest of the energy sector particularly on renewable energy technologies. Furthermore the scenario development will help us identify policy measures that can lead to least cost least greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A preliminary list of scenarios worth exploring include (1) continuous increase in shale gas in the mid to long run (baseline) (2) nation-wide implementation of a Californias low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) (3) carbon tax on fossil energy (4) federal and state subsidies and credits for low-carbon technologies and (5) relief of control over natural gas export largely to emerging countries like China and India to replace their coal combustion which would boost U.S. economy but likely bring domestic natural gas prices back pre-shale gas situations.

For such technologies understanding their life cycle impacts requires modeling potential changes that the technology in question will introduce to the economy and the environment. In particular the following questions and potential modeling approaches to address them will be discussed during the workshop: (1) The problem of curtailment in high-renewable electricity grid (2) The role of battery storage in mitigating curtailment and peak-shaving (3) Understanding the concept of marginal technologies (4) Modeling approaches to grid-response to large-scale battery storage and (5) Economies of scale and learning effects.

Sweet assessed the pools based on ecological requirements of the species. For pools to be suitable they must remain wet for a prolonged period long enough to develop a prey base for the larval CTS. For pools to be occupied they need to have surrounding habitat through which salamanders can disperse. The probability of occupancy increases in pools within 2 miles of occupied habitat off base. Suitable dispersal habitat needed microenvironments which were cool or shaded with gradual slopes down to the pools. The surrounding area of the pools needed friable soils or burrows which could shelter adult CTS during the nonbreeding season or years. In 2008 hoop-net and seine net samples of pools were conducted after pools had been inundated for about a month. No CTS were observed by these methods although samples were only taken once at each pool. The pools with suitable dispersal habitat had drift nets and pittraps installed; the drift nets will channel approaching CTS towards the pit traps. These traps were installed during the dry season and kept closed. Coverboards were also placed in areas with suitable dispersal and breeding habitat. Locations of coverboards and pools with driftnets were noted on GIS. Also in 2008 surveys near VAFB noted whether the introduced barred salamander were present. Barred salamanders were noted in many areas including the penitentiary pond and near Rucker Road next to La Purisima Mission. The close proximity of the barred salamanders highlights the conservation concerns for CTS. Barred salamanders may also be present on VAFB.

The site was owned and operated by Casmalia Resources and accepted approximately 5.6 billion pounds of waste between 1973 and 1989. Waste disposal units at the site included: 6 landfills for pesticides\/solvents metals caustic\/cyanides acids and non-liquid polychlorinated biphenyls; 43 surface impoundments; 15 evaporation pads; 2 non-hazardous waste spreading areas; 6 oil field spreading areas; 11 shallow injection wells; 7 disposal trenches; 1 drum burial unit; and 6 landfills. The site supports five stormwater ponds that may serve as an attractive nuisance to wildlife. The federally endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and federally threatened Calfornia red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) have been detected at the site. In 2001 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) entered into an agreement with EPA to extend a covenant not to sue for Natural Resource Damages to potentially responsible parties as part of a de minimis settlement. The Service received $178250 in settlement funds in exchange for the issuance of the covenant not to sue. The Service intends to use these funds to conduct restoration that will benefit the California red-legged frog California tiger salamander and other trust resources. Biological surveys were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s in support of EPAs ecological risk assessment and remedial investigation. Updated surveys are necessary in order to determine current usage of the site by our trust resources and to best guide the use of the limited settlement dollars available to conduct restoration. The Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office proposes to use the requested funding to conduct surveys for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander in strategic locations within the site and surrounding habitats to determine current usage of the site by these species. Surveys for California red-legged frogs were previously conducted in 1998 1999 2001 2002 2003 and 2004. Surveys for California tiger salamanders were conducted in 2002\/2003 and 2004\/2005. California red-legged frogs were detected in all survey efforts with the exception of 2004. California tiger salamanders were detected during drift fence surveys in 2004\/2005. Because California tiger salamander surveys have never been replicated at the site in the six years since the species was detected and because the species is so acutely imperiled within Santa Barbara County information about presence or absence of the species at the Casmalia Resources site would be invaluable. In addition previous surveys for California tiger salamanders established presence of metamorphosed individuals in upland habitat but the extent of California tiger salamander breeding in aquatic resources at the site remains unknown. The trend in observations of California red-legged frogs throughout the 1998 to 2004 study period demonstrated a rapid decline from over 50 individuals detected in 1998 to no individuals detected in 2003 or 2004. The absence of California red-legged frogs in 2003 and 2004 is suspected to be associated with low water levels in the stormwater ponds due to pumping of water for the construction of a landfill cap and increasing total dissolved solids (TDS) in the stormwater ponds. The water level in all ponds is currently high relative to 2003\/2004 however TDS remains high and the use of the ponds by California red-legged frogs and California tiger salamanders is unknown. It is likely that the high TDS is creating an attractive nuisance for the California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs attempting to breed at the site. This project will evaluate the need for (through aquatic and upland surveys) and feasibility of creating additional breeding ponds at the site to provide suitable breeding habitat away from areas with high TDS. Ponds will subsequently be created as deemed appropriate and monitored in subsequent years. The proposed surveys will assist the Service in providing technical assistance to EPA during the remedial process and implementing restoration for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander. Updated information about the use of the site by California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs will support the Services effort to work with EPA in evaluating and selecting a remedy that would provide maximum habitat for trust resources and understand the use of the site be these species. The study will be conducted in phases to achieve the overall objectives of the study.

The primary goal of this project is to develop actionable information for managers to retain snow on the landscape in ways that delay the stream hydrograph and improve the quantity and quality of summer low flows when aquatic ecosystems are most stressed. We will use three project objectives to meet this goal and achieve streamflow enhancement in numerous watersheds: 1) Determine optimum watershed-scale forest thinning strategies for the LTWP to enhance streamflow by retaining snow in key parts of the landscape 2) Provide baseline streamflow monitoring and develop tools to quantify the effects of forest treatments on streamflow and limiting factors for ecology across diverse watersheds 3) Develop 25- and 50-year forest management strategies in key watersheds to ensure streamflow enhancement gains under the combined effects of climate change drought and forest disturbance.

Support for an additional 1\/2 year will allow him to complete his integration of CZO hydrologic data and coupled eco-hydrologic modeling of climate responses for the CZO watersheds (see papers in prep 1 through 4). Results from previous modeling analysis demonstrate shifts between temperature and water limited responses to climate warming across a combination of micro-climate drainage-position and soil depth gradients defined by the CZO. We would like to extend this analysis to a broader regional scale. A large spatial extent would cover a larger elevational gradient and includes shifts in dominant conifer species. Results from this work will link analysis done at the CZO to a broader Southern Sierra context and several ongoing initiatives (NEON and a recent NSF funded study to look at climate-forest establishment in this region). Recent studies across the Western US and elsewhere document increasing rates of background mortality and drought related forest dieback (Allen et al. 2010). We expand our data-model integration to examine how site specific geoclimatic characteristics mediate the vulnerability of forests to these disturbances. We build on recent work demonstrating the application of RHESSys for a Ponderosa Pine forest in New Mexico where model accurate estimated spatial patterns of dieback during the early 2000s drought. We will estimate spatial patterns of drought-related mortality in the Southern Sierra CZO and examine where and under what conditions threshold responses are most likely to occur. This work will build on prior modeling and data collection at the CZO. We seek to fund a second PhD student for 1\/2 year. By providing overlap between past-CZO student Khongho Son in the Tague Ecohydrology Lab and a new student we facilitate technology transfer. Key tasks in this analysis will be a) improved data assimilation of existing vegetation data sets including LIDAR data flux tower and allometric measurements into the model to provide a more realistic baseline of existing vegetation carbon stores and b) parameterization of RHESSys estimates of vegetation drought responses across a range of species and soil characteristics within the CZO. We link this project with another ongoing USGS project - the Western Mountain and incorporate tree-ring and C13 isotope measurements in the Southern Sierra region as additional data to validate and parameterize our model. To drive RHESsys we use state-of-the art downscaling of GCM scenarios from Flint et al (2010) to 800m. GCM scenarios include downscaled NCAL GFDL and PCM models.

Extensive data sets empirical studies surveys and monitoring programs are linked via models to hindcast and forecast the effects of changing climate on forest dynamics distribution and productivity; fire occurrence and insect outbreaks; recovery of vegetation after disturbance; hydrologic changes and glacier dynamics; and the consequences of an altered water cycle for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and chemistry. We will address the extent to which climate drivers are mediated by regional- or watershed-scale controls on ecosystem processes thus quantifying vulnerability to climate change in mountain ecosystems.

Both the National Park Service and US Forest Service are developing science-based management approaches for adapting to climate change and WMI will collaborate directly with both agencies to ensure scientific consistency in the implementation of adaptation strategies. In the preceding phase of WMI research we used RHESSys to model ecosystem processes and hydrology in five forested montane watersheds representing diverse conditions across the western U.S. (sites in MT CO NM CA WA) (Christensen et al. 2008). In addition ongoing RHESSys applications as part of other projects include a range of watersheds throughout the West (Tague et al. 2008; Tague et al. in review). Analysis at the scale of these sites (<800 km2) is critical given that management of resources takes place at small watershed scales where process-based interactions are determined by gradients in snow temperature and radiation; spatial distribution of moisture; vegetation structure and pattern; and disturbances (fire insects mass movements). This abundant RHESSys model output is ready to be carried to the next level of interpretation.

Developing a clear understanding of climate & human-induced changes in environmental N cycling in tightly coupled atmospheric terrestrial & aquatic systems & understanding how these changes feed back into the climate system are critical to addressing this challenge. In the Pacific Northwest (PNW) the interactions among N carbon (C) climate & human activities are complex. The region has extensive & diverse agricultural lands surrounded by pristine natural ecosystems interspersed with heavily populated urban areas. The topography of the area is diverse & the terrain is drained by extensive river systems including the vast Columbia River Basin (CRB). Storm patterns are closely tied to the jet stream position & sensitive to long-term circulation patterns including the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) & Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO). Given this complexity a challenge is to understand & quantify the interactions & feedbacks between N & C cycling in coupled atmospheric terrestrial & aquatic systems as they are affected by the climate system at inter-annual to decadal time-scales over the PNW region. The overarching goal of this project is to improve understanding of the interactions among C N & H2O at the regional scale in the context of global change to inform decision makers strategies regarding natural & agricultural resource management.

This new seismological approach will utilize seismic networks that have become available in the United States and Mexico in the last 10 years now allow us to monitor hurricanes from seismic ground motions. The intensification of hurricanes is associated with strong pressure changes at the Earths surface that in turn lead to larger excitation of seismic ground motions.

The first goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the hurricane dynamics. The second goal is to develop a practical scheme to monitor the intensification of hurricanes by seismic data. This is useful for hazard mitigation especially if the intensity changes can be monitored remotely while a hurricane is still in the ocean.We have done this line of work using seismic data only from the US so far.

Although our vertebrate collections are modest in size they represent both a thorough synoptic collection for specimen based teaching and strong regional collections for research in evolution ecology and biogeography. The vertebrate collections have been used for research purposes mostly by students associated with the curators. They are used by academic personnel in several departments both at UCSB and elsewhere for teaching by the general public for conservation-based education and for our K-12 environmental education program Kids in Nature. The herpetology collection (over 13000 catalogued specimens of amphibians and reptiles) was started in 1977 to serve both research and teaching needs. The UCSB herpetological collections are focused on southwestern California a region that is significantly underrepresented elsewhere yet contains the contact areas for most of the state's main zoogeographic regions (i.e. the Coast Ranges San Joaquin Valley Sierra Nevada Mojave Desert Transverse Ranges and southern coastal plain). Southwestern California is at the hub of rapid tectonic and regional climate changes that are driving phylogeographic patterning in a majority of the resident species. The collection has had two primary foci. From 1977-1990 the primary emphasis was on collection-building targeting remote areas ecotones relict populations and areas soon to be alienated as natural habitat. Targeted work was directed at intergrade zones in a number of reptile taxa and isolated habitat areas with unusual species compositions as well as towards building useful series of hard-to-collect species. Since about 1990 the emphasis has shifted to documentation of the distributions and life histories of regionally declining threatened and endangered species. Life history materials particularly for amphibians are seldom well represented in western North American collections and the CCBER collection has strength in this area. Some of the most compelling arguments for federal listing of amphibian and reptile species in southern California have depended on the vouchers and data housed in CCBER and in the current regulatory environment these vouchers have been invaluable to state and federal agencies. Herpetological specimens were used in providing some of the biological and distributional data that resulted in the official listing of the California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the Arroyo Toad (Bufo microscaphus californicus) as endangered species by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (see Sweet 1991 1993 and Jennings 1994). Dr. Sam Sweet regularly uses the collection in his upper division courses at UCSB and to educate agency biologists regarding species of critical concern for this region and for general identification workshops. Most of the specimens are preserved in 70% denatured ethanol and some in 10% in formaldehyde. The CCBER ornithology collection (6245 catalogued specimens) and mammal collection (1745 specimens) are important regional collections that will exhibit modest targeted growth in the future. The collections were started by Drs. Mary Erickson and Barbara DeWolfe former faculty members in the department of Ecology Evolution and Marine Biology (EEMB). The mammal collection includes 172 addition our website contains images and information on the collections and the library and archives are used by campus and community members. Our award winning Kids in Nature program (received 2007 Governors award in Environmental Education) with over 100 5th graders enrolled as well as other K-12 classes visit our museum several times each year and participate in hands-on activities with various collections. The Vertebrate Collection Management Project fulfills several goals in our five-year strategic plan. For the past two years we have focused on improving collection usage and collection management procedures such as documentation data accessibility and preservation of our collections through museum best practices. As part of our strategic plan in 2008 we asked an external review panel of university faculty from across the country to meet with our faculty curators our directors and key staff (Goal 8). Their invaluable experience with university natural history collections similar to ours provided us with recommendations in several key areas: improving staffing and storage space for all collections databasing of all biological specimens and uploading them to appropriate federated databases and increasing faculty use of the collections campus-wide. We also successfully established a formal curator title on the UCSB campus (a two-year process) that will acknowledge the contributions of the faculty curators during their merit review process and appointed three new adjunct curators and three affiliates to CCBER.

Natural history collections represent the irreplaceable documentation of life on Earth. The Digitization of the UCSB Vascular Plant Collection project will provide UCSB faculty students CCBER staff environmental consultants and the general public with access to these valuable and historically significant collections but also contribute to a larger effort worldwide to digitize millions of biological specimens as quickly and efficiently as possible. The project will also provide the opportunity for student interns to learn new skills and increase their interest in the work to pursue employment or advanced degrees in museum studies or collection management. The Cheadle Center's lack of funding for steady employment of a data entry technician coupled with current data entry protocols indicate a best case scenario of over seven years to complete the databasing of the remaining mounted 57295 specimens. Our challenge is to make the data available in the most timely way. This will be done by adopting new workflows to capture label data from digital images and using optical character recognition software that can be entered directly into our database thus reducing keystrokes and improving our hourly rates of data entry. The project goals and activities will be accomplished in one year by hiring an imaging technician who will take digital images of all catalogued sheets and enter specimen data a project manager who will process images enter data and manage image and data uploads into a Specify database and student interns who will do data entry. In addition a taxonomist will oversee the curation mounting and cataloging of an additional 6200 backlogged specimens and will begin georeferencing completed records. At the end of the project images and specimen data will be available through a Specify web portal on our web site. Completed California specimen records will also be uploaded to the Consortium of California Herbaria database while additional specimens that are subsequently georeferenced will also be available to export to additional federated databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to be repurposed for use in floras species lists and historical distribution studies. The intended results of this project are: 1) improved databasing protocols and increased output leading to completion of the vascular plant collection 2) 71600 herbarium sheet images available for online identification and assistance in refining loans to relevant specimens 3) increased preservation of specimens by reduced handling over time 4) availability of new data sets for regional and statewide biodiversity studies and 5) increased potential workforce by retaining and educating interns. Additional benefits include improved loan management and tracking and safer long-term backup for images and data. We will evaluate and measure the success of our project through daily statistics quality checking and modification of protocols as needed to accomplish our goals monthly review of project activities and progress and yearly performance evaluations. The Cheadle Center's primary collection management goals are to prepare organize and catalog collections for greater accessibility and to make specimen data available online for all of our audiences. This project strengthens our ability to serve our audiences more effectively by supporting these goals and advancing the university's mission of Education Research and Outreach. Natural history collections represent the irreplaceable documentation of life on Earth. CCBERs botanical collections contribute to discovering understanding and documenting biodiversity and to informing public policy on such issues as invasive species species extinction and climate change.
